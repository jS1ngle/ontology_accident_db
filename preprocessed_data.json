Pickling wasperformed in baths (10m long, 40m3 capacity) with water containingHF(1%-3%) and HNO3 (4%-6%) at 50 C-60 C. During the oxides dissolution,the fumes produced (containing HNO3, HF, NO2 and NO) were aspirated bymeans of ventilators and scrubbed in two stages (the system blockdiagram is shown in Fig. 3 attached to the Original Report). Nitricacid was neutralized in the first absorption tower with sodiumhydroxide. Nitrogen oxide was oxidized whilst nitrogen dioxide wasreduced with an alkaline solution of KMnO4. The waste waters from theabsorption towers, containing nitrites and nitrates, were neutralizedwith sodium hypochlorite added from a 2 m3 transfer tank automaticallyfilled by means of a pump.

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:In a sodium hypochlorite transfer tank, an unknown amount of sodium hypochlorite flowed into the overfilling pipe owing to the blockage of the float valve (due to the presence of crystals) that controlled the level in the tank. Therefore, when the level reached the maximum value, the valve did not stop the pump. The overfilling pipe was connected with a tank installed below, covered with a metal grid, which was containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite with the two acids produced chlorine gas and probably fluoride gas. The release occurred at 08:45 am. In the area there were 6 employees and each of them noticed a strong smell of chlorine and left the building as soon as possible. The security department was immediately alerted which in turn alerted the medical service and the management. A 4 men rescue team was formed and instructed to enter the pickling section to check if someone was still there. They were also instructed to switch-off the equipment. The rescue team found that the sodium hydroxide transfer tank had overflowed and the liquid had run into the tank below containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The pump which was transferring the sodium hypochloryte from the storage tank to the transfer tank had already stopped. Since chlorine gas is heavier than air, it was expected that it would take some time for the chlorine vapours to disperse from the building. At about 17:00 hours the production was started up again since no more than 1ppm concentration of chlorine could be detected in the production hall by means of Draeger tubes.

CAUSES:In a sodium hypochlorite transfer tank, an unknown amount of sodium hypochlorite flowed into the overfilling pipe owing to the blockage of the float valve (due to the presence of crystals) that controlled the level in the tank. Therefore, when the level reached the maximum value, the valve did not stop the pump (the control had only temporarily jammed since the rescue team found that the pump had automatically stopped).

The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite (a very strong oxidizing agent) with the two acids produced chlorine gas (by oxidation of chlorides) and probably fluoride gas (by oxidation of fluorides) but there is no evidence of it.Besides, the emergency level (i.e. the level at which the stop signal was given to the transfer pump) was too close to the overfilling pipe. This, together with the excessive length (about 75 metres) of the piping between the pump and the transfer tank, may cause the tank overfilling even if the pump stops when the liquid reaches the emergency level.Finally, the overfilling pipe from the transfer tank was erroneously connected (due to inadequate process analysis and plant design) with the tank below which may contain acids.Remarks: No data areavailable about the amount of released sodium hypochlorite and ofnitric acid and hydrogen fluoride contained in the transfer tank.

During the start-up, the released ethylene oxide reacted exothermically with the binders of the lagging and this caused a temperature increase that ignited the ethylene oxide;2. the development of a hot spot in a quiescent area of the column caused by the polymerization of ethylene oxide catalysed by rust deposits (this is less likely because no conclusive evidence of it was found).",

A layer of the escaped gas developped close to the drain ditches of the area where the leakage occurred. The vinyl chloride vapours, being 2.5 times heavier than air, remained closed to the ground. The slightly elevated rails of the railway serving the area acted initially as a dike and contained the gas cloud. Atmospheric conditions and water curtains created by the plant fire brigade managed to contain the cloud close to the leakage point until it had been diluted by convection. The evaporation of liquid vinyl chloride had been promoted by the water draining from the water curtains. The source of the release was identified 45 minutes after the leakage was detected; the leaking pipeline was isolated soon after that. The company firemen checked the roads around the factory with explosimeters and the response was negative everywhere. Besides, they irrigated the area where the leakage occurred and made a screen from each side. The Security chief called Service 100 to signal the leak and to ask the firemen to take up position around the factory in case gas layer moved to the outside. Sambreville fire brigade was called and took position around the plant fence on the side opposite the site of the leak but its intervention was not necessary, since repeated gas concentration measuremets at the boundary of the factory resulted negative. The railway traffic in the city of Jemeppe was interrupted during the accident, from 23:32 till 03:08 next morning.

The leakage had been detected at 23:10, the leaking point had been identified at 23:55 and the piping isolation took place around 00:05. From this moment, the leakage was decreasing until the gas cloud was practically dispersed at 01:30.

The auto-oxidation of the PEG ignited the insulation and the resulting heat flux heated the metal wall of the piping of the level instrumentation system. The heating of the stagnant liquid of the level instrument stand pipe caused the ethylene oxide to decompose. The decomposition continued into the column K-303 which exploded (the confined vapour explosion began in the lower section of the column). The gas supply line to column K-302 (carrying gases from the head of column K-303) was torn off and the escaping gas caught fire. After the pressure decreased, the flames backed into the column K-302 and caused an internal explosion (approximately 26 seconds after the first explosion). The two explosions caused the impact of debris in other sections of the ethylene oxide/glycol installation and was followed by a huge fire. The recycle gas loop was hit by debris and the released gas burned as a jet-fire. The plant fire fighting team was able to confine the fire and to put it under control in less than one hour.

During the pressurising of the installation this air was mixed with ethylene at 170 bar and 200 C. Under this conditions the oxygen in the air reacted with ethylene (acts as catalyst) and started the decomposition of ethylene. This decomposition is strongly exothermic and the system reached 270 bar and 700 C (calculated). At first this caused a safety valve further in the installation to open with a visible soot emission. The safety valves on the ruptured pipe didn't open because they were set at a higher pressure. The pipe ruptured due to weakening by the high temperature. Calculations afterwards showed that the pipe's resistance was lowered to 150 bar at 700 C. Due to the fact that the decomposition took place in the start up phase, only intermediate pressure, the temperature could rise considerably before the pressure reached the setpoint of the safety valves. During normal production, the working pressure is much closer to the setpoint of the safety valves, so they can act more adequately as a release and safety measure for this scenario. general pipework/flanges general pipework/flanges",

The terminal is situated at some distance from the refinery it is connected with.- 4 large crude oil tanks of which 3 are situated in a row and a fourth crude oil tank is situated before the second tank. These storage tanks are identified as D1, D2, D3 and D4;- 2 smaller slop oil tanks, D10 and D11;- a very small crude oil tank D26.The crude oil tanks D1, D2, D3 and D4 have a capacity of 40 000 m3 and the slop oil tanks D10 and D11 have a capacity of 24 000 m3.The crude oil is delivered by pipeline and is pumped by pipeline to the Refinery.On September 12th, 2005 a minor incident occurred at the storage tank D3. During this incident an amount of 35 m3 crude oil leaked from the bottom of the tank. The exact cause of this incident is not yet known. At the moment the major accident occurred with tank D2 cleaning operations for storage tank D3 were just started in order to inspect storage tank D3 and to determine the causes of the incident of September 12th.At the moment the major accident happened the slop oil tank D10 was full, the slop oil tank D11 was empty, the crude oil tank D4 was partially full, the crude oil tank D2 was for 75% full en the tanks D1, D3 en D26 were empty and in revision.2. Chronological description of the accident and the interventionOn October 25, 2005 around 18.15h a major leak at tank D2 was detected. Storage tank D2 contained at that moment almost 33 000 m3 crude oil. Information from the DCS-system situated in the off-sites control room of the refinery indicates that the full inventory of storage tank D2 was released within 10 minutes. Because the contents of the storage tank was released in such a short time, an enormous wave appeared. Due to the amount of crude that was released, the bund was filled ( 40 000 m2 large) with crude up to a height of 1 m. Due to the effect of the crude wave, a small amount of 3 m3 of crude was ejected out of the bund into a nearby creek.After the release the storage tank was leaning forward. It also seamed that the storage tank was sledded of his foundation, although it is not clear if this was a cause or rather a consequence of the incident. Initially the fire brigade started to cover the bund with fire fighting foam to avoid ignition of the crude oil and to reduce the smell. Directly a large amount of fire fighting foam was donated by the Refinery, other (petro)chemical companies and the fire brigade to cover the very large bund area with foam. Due to the very strong wind that evening and the use of different types of fire fighting foam they did not succeeded to cover the whole bund with foam. Especially the inner part of the large bund (where al the piping and valves are situated) stayed even after several hours uncovered. On the other hand the strong wind had the advantage that no explosive atmosphere was formed above the spill.The contents of the slop oil tank D10 and the crude oil tank D4 was immediatly pumped to storage tanks situated at the refinery itself. The contents of the bund is firstly pumped to the slop oil tank D11. In order to fill the slop oil tank D10 and de crude oil tank D4 with the product in the bund, some manual valves had to be handled. Because of the presence of piping, valves and walking platforms in the bund, is was not possible to reach the valves by boat. Therefore two operators (fully protected with chemical overalls and breathing apparatus) have walked through the crude and manipulated the valves.During the next two days the mixture of crude oil, fire fighting foam and water was pumped to the storage tanks D10 and D4. This was done at a velocity of 900 m3 an hour. Afterwards a part of this mixture was send to storage tanks at the refinery. In the afternoon of October 27th , 2005 the bund was mostly empty, except of some smaller pools of crude oil. These pools were removed by vacuum cleaning trucks.On October 28th, 2005 the intervention was finished and the cleaning up of the terminal could start. 3. CommentsThe storage tank D2 was built in 1970. At that moment the storage terminal belonged to XX. It was sold in 1990 to the Refinery. At that moment all the tanks were inspected and repaired if necessary. This was also the case for storage tank D2. The inspection before the tank D2 was used again was done in 1991. From 1994 until now each 3 years an external inspection was performed. These inspections showed almost no remarks. Next year a total revision of the storage tank was planned. Every three years setting measurements of the storage tanks were carried out. The last measurements were done in 2004. These measurements showed no anomalies.At this moment the cause of this major accident is not yet know. There are some indications that a subsidence (movement of the soil) could have caused this accident, because one month before this accident the crude oil tank D3 also had a leak. More investigation on both tanks is necessary to know if both accidents are related with each other.Two days after the accident, the bund was nearly empty. At that moment it was clearly visible that a part of the foundation of storage tank D2 had disappeared. Parts of the foundation were found in the bund over a distance of 20 to 30 m. An important concern after the accident is the stability of all storage tanks at the storage terminal at the left bank. For the moment each day setting measurements are performed. To reduce the risk of another release, most part of the contents of the storage tanks D4, D10 and D11 are pumped to the refinery where it was shipped to Rotterdam. Afterwards these tanks were partially filled with water in order to let the roof float.For the moment the terminal only contains sludge. This sludge is present in the storage tanks D4, D10, D11 and D2.After the accident the company organized already 8 inspections with the authorities in order to discuss al measures they are taking concerning safety and environment. Also a public hearing for the neighbourhood was organized.4. Clean-up operationsThe Refinery has set up a project group in order to make the terminal safe and start the cleaning of the terminal.In order to reduce the smell in the neighbourhood. The bund area is covered with sand, except the zone in front of the storage tank D2. Because the tank is leaning forward, it was not safe to enter the bund and in that area a lot of sludge was still present. This sludge containing a lot of sand is very viscous and has an average depth of 1 m.From November 6th, 2005 the storage tank D2 is stabilized by 4 mayor cranes. These cranes that can support the total mass of the storage tank are placed on a service way just outside the bund.After the stabilisation of the storage tank D2, two manholes of the storage tank were opened. Measurements indicated that the atmosphere in the storage tank was not explosive. They also saw that the floating roof had properly landed on his supports (legs). Nevertheless the company does not want operators to enter the storage tank to remove the sludge. For that reason they have ordered a robot to suck the sludge out of the storage tank.In the next week a profound investigation of the soil will start. Firstly drillings until a depth of 2 to 3 m will be performed to measure the soil contamination. Afterwards drilling until a depth of 25 to 30 m will be performed to measure the stability of the soil at the terminal and in the surroundings. False False False False fluid release to ground",

The accident took place at the Petroplus Refinery facility in Antwerp, Belgium. During the loading of red gas oil from a land tank to a ship an overfilling of one of the tanks on the ship occurred. The overfilling went on for about 20 minutes before the loading operation was stopped. As a result, 193 m# of the product was released in the surface water. An area of approximately 25 ha of surface water was polluted with 150 tonnes of red gas oil . There were no casualties, and no damage was done to any of the installations. Actions takenAfter an alarm was given on the ship by the crew (at 5.50 am) refinery personnel interrupted the loading operation by activating the emergency stop on the land side. The loading pumps were stopped from the dispatch centre, and the loading arm was closed at the quay. Absorption materials were placed at the front and the back of the ship. The authorities were informed. Two specialised companies were contacted to fight the water pollution. The dock was closed for shipping movements for four days during the cleaning operation.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On Wednesday may 4th around 20.00h, a short but intensive fire took place at the naphtha cracking unit of the Total Refinery Antwerp.Ten ovens are part of the naphtha cracking unit. In these ovens the feed stream naphtha is cracked into smaller molecules. Periodically these ovens need to be decoked to assure an optimal cracking of the molecules. When the accident took place the oven B20 had to be decoked. To start the decoking procedure, the feed to the oven must be closed. Next the oven must be flushed with steam. Afterwards an air flow is sent into the oven to burn the carbon, which is deposed at the inner walls of the cracking tubes, in a controlled manner. Around 19.15h the naphtha feed to the oven B20 was stopped by closing a automatic valve. The 4 control valves (not at the entrance of the oven were also closed. The operator in the control room performed these actions. After performing these remote actions, some manual operations had to take place in the neighborhood of the ovens. A figure indicating the configuration of the valves involved in the accident and their final state after the accident is attached to the report.The manual actions that had to be performed were the following ones:- First a manual valve placed just before the automatic valve on the naphtha feed had to be closed. On the figure this manual valve is situated left from the automatic valve;- Next the naphtha feed line had to be flushed with steam for a short period (called short steam flush). To do so the automatic valve had to be opened manually;- Afterwards the drain situated between the manual valve and the automatic valve had to be opened to let the steam escape. By doing so the remaining naphtha in the feed pipe between the manual and automatic valve could be removed;- After the remaining naphtha was removed, a blind plate had to be placed under the manual valve, in order to guarantee that during the decoking of the ovens it is impossible to sent naphtha to the oven (by mistake).- Finally the oven had to be flushed with steam during 30 minutes (called long steam flush).Just before the accident happened the two victims were situated in the neighborhood of the valves that had to be manipulated. Other operators who were working 30 to 40 m away from that place suddenly heard a thud explosion followed by an intensive fire.Because sprinklers were situated above the valves, a water curtain was available in the immediate surroundings of the valves and monitors were available to the north and south of the place of the fire, the fire was extinguished after a few minutes.After the fire was extinguished it was established that the drain situated right from the automatic valve was opened and the plug, which is usually used to guarantee that no fluid is leaking out of the drain (if the drain valve leaks a little bit), was found on the floor. This drain was another one than the one described in the list of manual actions that had to be performed before the oven could be decoked. False False False False flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)",
        "causes_description": "causes:  Chronology of the accidentThe two victims, who were still following the training program to become operators, went to the place where the valves should be manipulated before starting the decoking of oven B20. The operator, who had the function of oven operator in that shift, had the intention to follow them (after he found his helmet).One of the operators in training has opened the drain right from the automatic valve. A lot of naphtha came out of the drain. The amount of naphtha that was released was much more than he expected and much more than the amount that came free the other times he performed this task. The amount of naphtha that came free must have been 300 to 400l, this is the contents of the line between the automatic valve and the inlet of the oven. Once he noticed that a lot of naphtha that was released, he wanted to close the drain valve, but it was already too late. He saw the cloud of naphtha was ignited by the hot walls of the nearby oven. The description of the actions the operator in training performed was in line with the situation in which the installation was found after the fire. The operator in training claimed that he did not perform the actions in another way than he normally did to decoke an oven. Although he was still following the training program to become oven operator he performed this task already several times (but he did not now how many times).Direct causesOne of the most important causes of this accident is the fact that two operators who were still following the training program to become oven operator were performing tasks without any supervision.The day the accident happened there were enough operators available in the evening shift to fulfill all necessary functions. In the shift it was decided that the manual tasks before decoking oven B20 should be performed by the two victims. The operators in the shift believed that the two victims had already enough knowledge and experience to perform these actions correctly. One hour before they had to perform these tasks, the operator with the function oven operator explained to them that they were going to decoke oven B20 and what they had to do. Unfortunately this was not put into a report. The moment the operator in the control room announced that de automatic valve on the naphtha feed was closed, the two victims got the instruction to perform the manual tasks. The operator who had the function of oven operator had the intention to follow them after he found his helmet. The moment the operator left the building the fire already started.In the shift there was a lot of confidence in the knowledge of the two operators in training. Their training file contained already personal notes with the answer on the question which actions they had to perform for the decoking of an oven. The answer of the second victim was correct, but it described the tasks more generally. The answer of the first victim contained all the details of the manual actions that had to be taken before the oven can be decoked. The operators in training answered that question as a preparation of the examination that they had to pass to become a certified operator to perform the function of oven operator.During the investigation of the accident it was found that the two victims had followed an operator performing the manual tasks before the decoking of an oven several times. The ovens in the naphtha cracking unit are installed by two. Therefore the configuration of the naphtha feed and the corresponding valves of the odd ovens is the mirror image of the configurations of the even ovens. Because the two operators in training assisted the manual actions on several ovens, they where aware of the fact that there are two mirror image configurations. Although it could be demonstrated that both victims followed the manual tasks several times, it is not recorded how many times they just looked how the oven operator did it and how many times they did it themselves.Indirect causesAs mentioned above the second victim was convinced that the day of the accident he did not do anything different than what he had learned the past months. If this fact was true, it was possible that an operator gave him the wrong instructions during the training period. It is always possible that in order to save some time someone did not perform the short steam flush correctly, but would open the drain directly to release the naphtha between the manual and automatic valve (2 to 3 l naphtha) before performing the long steam flush. If on the day of the accident the second victim would perform the manual tasks in this way and made a mistake between the drain left and right from the automatic valve, this could explain what went wrong the evening of the accident.To exclude that the performing of the manual tasks before decoking an oven had been instructed in the wrong manner, the records stored in the computer system of the decoking actions during the last few months have been printed out. During the short steam flush the automatic valve must be lifted manually. This action is detected on the computer system. If someone would release the naphtha by opening the drain, without a short steam flush, then the automatic valve is not lifted. This difference can be detected by the computer system. The printed files indicated that the past months the ovens were 60 times decoked. The analysis of the printed files also showed that in more than 90% of the cases, it is absolutely sure that the short steam flush was performed correctly. For the other 10 % it was noticed that in some cases it was sure that the actions were not performed correctly, but for some cases it could not be detected if the actions were performed right of wrong. The data stored in the computer system only gives information about the signals that took more than 30 seconds. The short steam flush mostly takes a few minutes, but is more efficiently not to open the automatic valve during two minutes, but to flush several times during a shorter period (to achieve a pumping effect). This means that if an operator lifts the automatic valve 5 times during 20 seconds, these actions are not stored in the computer system, because each period is less than 30 seconds. In the cases where it was sure that the actions were wrong it appeared that these actions could not be related to one shift ore one person. Based on these print outs it can be concluded that de manual actions before decoking an oven are not systematically performed wrongly. training/instruction operator error",

The bottom stream was recirculated over the tank farm back to the feed. The morning of August 22nd, the panel operator instructed one of the operators to change the hose connection to a different line in order to run off to a tank. The operator isolated the circulation, blew the hose empty and disconnected it. He then moved the hose under the manifold and picked it up on the other side to connect it to a different line. From what we now know, he must have picked up another hose and connected the wrong hose to the line and left the hose from the bottom stream of the column on the floor with an open end. He gave the all clear signal to the panel operator to start running off to the tank. He walked the line from that point to the tank and found no leaks.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  SUMMARYAt approximately 14.00 on Sunday 9th April there was an explosion followed by a fire at the Distillation Unit 1. The specific distillation column K23 was shut down at the time of the incident for scheduled maintenance when a heat exchanger exploded and the cumene ignited. The automatic systems for foaming were activated and the on-site emergency services were quickly on the scene. They were joined by the external emergency services. The fire was extinguished at 15.23. Two firemen were taken to hospital having come into contact with cumene, a mild irritant. They were released following check-up and have suffered no long-term effects. There was no environmental issue outside of the plant area and there was no risk to the local community. It was found that there was an unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) in the upper part of column K23 during normal operation. During the shut down of the column, the MHP was enriched in the aqueous side draw. Because of specific circumstances parts of this water could flow into the hot heat exchanger, where a thermal explosion of the MHP containing liquid led to an over pressurization of the apparatus. The explosion tore off the feed and outlet pipes. Cumene mainly leaked from the long pipe towards a buffer tank and ignited. Cumene is a colorless, flammable liquid.INCIDENT DESCRIPTIONOn Sunday April 9th K23 was being shutdown in order to perform a regulatory inspection of the column reboiler. The shutdown of K23 was being conducted as outlined in the procedure. The first focus in shutting down K23 was stopping the feed and evacuating the bottom of the column. At 13.17, the feed to K23 from the Cumene Extraction Unit was stopped by closing a manual valve at the Cumene Extraction Unit. At approximately the same time, the level controller for the sump of K23 was placed in manual operation with a fixed valve position to allow K23 to be pumped empty to Tank 93. The level of K23's sump immediately began to decrease, reaching 10% by 13.19. The level remained stable at 10%, although material was continually pumped from K23. This is an indication that the level transmitter was not reporting correctly and that the actual level was below the lower nozzle of the level instrument. Based on calculations, it is estimated that approximately 1 m3 of material remained in K23 below the lower nozzle of its level instrument. At 13.25, K23's bottom pump began to cavitate, indicating that the column was nearly empty, and was shut down at 13.28. The bottoms product from K23 is cooled by the feed in a preheater (WBG2336). Having already shut off the feed to K23, there was no cooling of the bottoms product as indicated by a temperature rise on the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93. This temperature indicator reached a maximum temperature of 128  C at 13.24, which is the same time that K23 was empty.The second focus in shutting down K23 was preventing low boiling components from entering the bottom of the column. To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period. At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty. At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output. The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel. This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23. At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output. At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%. The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305. At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1. The sprinkler and foam systems for Distillation Unit 1 were immediately activated. The site emergency response team quickly responded to the incident and was later joined by outside emergency services. The fire could not be extinguished until 15.23 due to being unable to successfully isolate fuel sources from the fire.

        "causes_description": "causes:  FAILURE ANALYSISThe explosion occurred at WBG2336, which is a spiral heat exchanger that is used to heat up the feed to K23 by cooling down the bottom product. During normal operation the feed is heated and the bottoms product is cooled from 145  C. The feed to K23 enters WBG2336 at the side and exits at the top (cold side of the heat exchanger). The bottom product from K23 enters WBG2336 at the bottom and exits at the side (hot side of the heat exchanger). During the modified operation the aqueous side draw from BBG2305 was added to the exit of this stream. Based on the inspection of WBG2336, it was determined that the failure resulted from the over pressurization in the hot side of the heat exchanger. The spiral failed at a pressure between 10 and 15 barg. Such a pressure could be reached by for example a gas explosion. Four scenarios were identified during the incident investigation as possible causes of the over pressurization. The scenarios are as follows: Thermal Expansion occurring during a blocked in condition CHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger MHP slowly decomposing to form hydrogen and oxygen thereby creating an atmosphere which at only low activation energy could lead to an explosion  MHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger.Thermal ExpansionDuring the shut down of the column there were several manual valves closed in order to isolate K23 from other processes. Therefore, the possibility for a blocked in condition of WBG2336 needed to be evaluated. The feed to WBG2336 was stopped by closing a manual valve (V1) in the Cumene Extraction Unit. After K23 had been emptied and the bottom pump was stopped, the manual valve (V2) at the discharge of the pump was closed. This isolated WBG2336 from the bottom of K23, but allowed for an opening at the outlet from WBG2336 to Tank 93. At this same time, the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 was also shut. Shortly after that, approximately 9 minutes, the operator realized that he had closed the wrong valve. At this point the operator opened the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 and closed the manual valve (V4) at the cold side inlet to WBG2336. A spike in the flow meter (FR82331) on the feed line to K23 provides an indication of this valve manipulation. Based on the short period of time of the blocked in condition and short duration of the associated flow spike, the pressure buildup was determined to be insufficient to cause damage to WBG2336. It was also determined that the severity of the damage to WBG2336 could not have been caused by thermal expansion. Therefore, this scenario was eliminated as a possible cause for the over pressurization of WBG2336.Spontaneous Decomposition of CHPDuring normal operation of K23, there is approximately 2% CHP in the feed to and bottom product from the column. Due to the highly reactive nature of CHP, the possibility of spontaneous decomposition needed to be evaluated. An analysis of the material from the bottom of K23 at 10.00 on April 9th showed that the CHP content was 1.43%, which was in line with expected values. An analysis of a sample from the feed line to WBG2336 following the incident indicated that the CHP content was 0.92%, which was slightly below the expected value. Based on testing it is known that even at a temperature of 140  C, no instantaneous decomposition of 2% CHP would occur. In a weak acid system, pH &gt; 2, CHP would decompose mainly to DMPC and ACP through thermal decomposition. It would also decompose partially to phenol and acetone through acid catalyzed decomposition. Based on this information the spontaneous decomposition of CHP was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurization of WBG2336.MHP Decomposition to Hydrogen and OxygenDuring normal operation, there was approximately 0.2% MHP in the feed, 0.1% in the bottom product, and below 3% in the aqueous phase of K23's side draw. A partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. However, samples taken from the side draw receiver (BBG2305) and the overhead receiver (BBG2303) following the incident showed increased levels of MHP in both vessels. After the incident the MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 28 and 8 % respectively. The pH figures of both liquids were below 3. Although it was known that the feed to column K23 contained only small amounts of MHP, it was not known that MHP could be concentrated in localized areas. A literature review on this topic identified only one case where increased MHP concentrations were linked to an explosion in a process for making surfactants. Due to the lack of physical properties for MHP, this condition is difficult to model. However, after making certain assumptions, a simulation for the operation of K23 could be performed. The simulation indicated that MHP could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operation with a peak of around 7%. Obviously, as shown by the analysis of material in BBG2305 after the incident, the MHP was concentrated up to a much higher concentration. This was probably caused during specific shut down conditions at relatively high reflux ratios. The identified location of the MHP peak was between the top tray, where reflux is added to the column, and just above the side draw. Thus, the temperature profile and outlet configuration could allow for K23 to reach equilibrium with an area of localized high concentration of MHP in the top section and low concentrations in all of the outlet streams. K23 is designed so that all liquid contained above the side draw is directed to BBG2305. Therefore, when K23 is shut down and its contents are allowed to flow into the bottom, the concentrated MHP would flow into BBG2305 where it would be separated with the aqueous phase and be pumped to Tank 93. This condition is supported by the sample analysis from material in BBG2305 following the incident, which indicated MHP concentrations that were much higher than expected during normal operation. In addition to MHP the simulation showed a much lower peak for hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which was in the feed to the column, too. With a concentration of 20 wppm in the feed the estimated peak was 100 wppm besides the 7 % MHP. The H2O2 concentration in BBG2305 after the incident was determined to be 385 wppm besides 28 % MHP. As well as for MHP the calculated maximal concentration for H2O2 is lower than the analyzed figure, due to a probably higher accumulation during the shut down procedure. Normally, the cumene at the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93 is at a temperature of 35  C. However, after the feed to K23 was stopped, the temperature of WBG2336 increased to at least 128  C. This is indicated on the temperature indicator at the outlet of WBG2336 to Tank 93. A review of the piping configuration indicated that in addition to being exposed to the hot cumene exiting WBG2336, the aqueous phase, due to a difference in density, could also migrate into the hot side of the heat exchanger. The bottom section of WBG2336's hot side could be filled with aqueous material by displacement of the hot cumene. This displacement is indicated by a temperature increase from 109  C to 134  C on temperature indicator TR82374. Similarly, the top section of WBG2336's hot side could accumulate a vapor phase that could be generated through the decomposition of MHP. Since the hot side of WBG2336 was not equipped with a vent line, this vapor phase would accumulate down to the side outlet of the heat exchanger from where it would then begin to flow into the transfer line to Tank 93. Based on mechanical drawings, it is estimated that the maximum volume of vapor that would accumulate in WBG2336 would be 175 liters. Following a discussion with specialists in the field of explosion testing, it is now known that vapor phases containing hydrogen concentrations in the range of 16% to 90%, with the remainder being composed of oxygen, could be ignited with minimal energy input and a detonation would occur. Under these conditions, even small explosive gas volumes could result in excessive localized pressure upon ignition. Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the formation of an explosive atmosphere with hydrogen and oxygen, resulting from the decomposition of MHP, needed to be evaluated, as the review of the system indicated no path for oxygen to enter the system from the atmosphere. The Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC) for hydrogen is 4.3 Vol% at normal conditions. Taking into account the higher temperature in the heat exchanger, the LOC was around 3.8 Vol%. A hydrogen containing gas atmosphere with more than 4 Vol % of hydrogen is only explosive if at the same time the oxygen concentration is above the LOC.Based on a few former investigations, it was known that MHP decomposes to hydrogen. The reaction is relatively fast at a high pH and low at a pH below 7. The reaction is enhanced by adding formaldehyde to the MHP containing solution, but again only hydrogen is formed. Oxygen could only be formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which is present in the aqueous stream (2) from BBD0020. The concentration of H2O2 in the cumene stream (1), which was the feed to K23, was analyzed to be below 20 wppm. The H2O2 concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 385 and 50 wppm respectively, besides the much higher MHP concentrations of 28 % and 8 % respectively. Based on this a simultaneous formation of significant amounts of oxygen from H2O2 besides hydrogen formation from MHP was very unlikely. To verify the mechanism of hydrogen formation from MHP and to exclude a simultaneous formation of critical amounts of oxygen at low pH, several decomposition tests were made. The tests were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2), as well as with the liquid from BBG2305, taken after the incident. The tests were made in a special adiabatic calorimeter (Vent Sizing Package calorimeter VSP). Around 65 ml were filled in a 110 ml vessel, which was then closed and set under a slight vacuum. The vessel was heated until the thermal decomposition occurred and the content heated up itself under adiabatic conditions. The vessel was cooled down to around ambient temperature and a gas sample was taken. The analyzed gas concentrations were corrected to take into account preliminary air content from slight vacuum. At each test a double gas analysis was made. No peroxides could be analyzed from the remaining liquid, thus there was always a total decomposition. In addition to the gas analysis, such calorimetric tests deliver information about reaction heat and reaction dynamics, see chapter 4.4. In case of a very violent reaction (runaway) the VSP vessel bursts and the content is released to a secondary compartment, which is filled with nitrogen. Ten tests (run 1 to 10) were made.Runs 1 to 6 were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2) from the process, at different pH. In general, mainly hydrogen is formed in an amount of 25 to 35 mol% of the initial amount of MHP. That fits very well to the operational experience of Thermi I. The amount of oxygen varies with the pH. At a low pH, only 20 mol% in maximum of the H2O2 are converted to oxygen. That is not surprising, because in the presence of MHP, formaldehyde is formed which reacts with H2O2 to form hydrogen, too. In contrast, the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is around 100 % at a pH of 7. At a higher pH the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is again reduced. From these test runs a reaction heat of around 340 kJ per mol MHP could be determined. The activation energy of the decomposition reaction is around 120 kJ/mol. These figures indicate that the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic and increases rapidly with increasing temperature. The gas formation is around 12.4 ln (standard norm liter) per mol MHP. Runs 7 to 10 were made with the MHP containing stream from BBG2305. As already mentioned above, only small amounts of H2O2 (385 wppm) were in this stream. Run 7 was made with a diluted sample to be able to get gas samples. Unfortunately the gas analysis failed, but from the exothermic reaction a similar reaction heat was found, as in the tests before. Run 8 was made with a higher concentrated MHP solution of 15.8 %. The reaction behaviour of a solution with such a higher MHP concentration is also described in a Japanese paper. As expected, the calorimeter burst and the content was released into the secondary compartment. A gas sample could not be taken. The results from this test about reaction dynamics of such a higher concentrated MHP solution will be discussed in chapter 4.4. Runs 9 and 10 were made again with a lower concentrated solution to get reliable gas concentrations from the decomposition. Again it could be shown that mainly hydrogen is formed besides small and uncritical amounts of oxygen.For all tests an analyzed concentration of lower than 0.5 Vol% oxygen should be considered as an inaccuracy of taking and analyzing the gas samples. Significant higher concentrations could only be found from decomposition of solutions with significant amounts of H2O2, see runs 1 to 6. As only small amounts of H2O2 were present in the side stream from K23 besides a high concentration of MHP, the decomposition could only lead to low concentrations of oxygen, see runs 9 to 10. The decomposition of such a solution could not lead to an explosive gas atmosphere. The oxygen concentration would have been always below the Limiting Oxygen Concentration of 3.8 Vol%. Based on these results, the formation of an explosive gas atmosphere and a successive ignition was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurisation of WBG2336. Nevertheless it will be recommended to develop guidelines for proper handling of liquids containing MHP and/or H2O2 to prevent any accumulation of flammable atmosphere.Spontaneous Decomposition of MHPAs stated in the previous section, normal MHP concentrations are relatively low throughout the system and a partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. Samples taken from the system, following the incident indicated MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 as 28 and 8 % respectively. Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the spontaneous decomposition of MHP, leading to a thermal explosion, needed to be evaluated. A thermal explosion of a reactive liquid, what is also called a runaway reaction, leads to a temperature and pressure increase due to the heat and gas formation, all effects increasing exponentially with increasing temperature. As already described in the previous section, the MHP concentration in the column could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operations. Therefore, when K23 was shut down, the concentrated MHP could flow into BBG2305 where it was separated with the aqueous phase and pumped to Tank 93. As described in the previous section, this aqueous material could migrate to WBG2336 and filled the bottom section of the exchanger's hot side after stopping the pump PBG2300. Based on the temperature indication at the outlet of the hot side, it is known that this area was at a temperature of at least 128  C. At this temperature, it was known that MHP will thermally decompose. However, both the decomposition velocity, nor the amount of energy that would be generated by this elevated concentration of MHP, were not known yet. The test run 8, was made with a solution of 15.8 % MHP and took place under adiabatic conditions. The test showed a continuous increase of temperature up to 180 C and an increase of pressure because of gas formation. At this temperature, the pressure was around 20 bar and the vessel burst. From this test the kinetics of the MHP decomposition could be evaluated, which allows to calculate the temperature and pressure increase over time for adiabatic conditions and various conditions regarding MHP concentration and starting temperature. Based on the reaction heat of 340 kJ/mol, an aqueous solution would heat up with around 17 C per one percent decomposed MHP under adiabatic conditions. The Japanese paper, presents some results from decomposition tests of MHP solutions up to 16.3 %. A reaction heat of 341 kJ/mol MHP was found, what is very similar to the results from the own investigations. For the 16.3 % MHP solution a maximal heat rate of around 20 C per second is reported in the Japanese paper, what was the maximal detection rate in that test apparatus. From the experiment at Degussa with a 15.8% MHP solution a heat rate of 30 C per second was detected, just before the vessel burst at 180 C. Thus, for the same MHP concentration the decomposition rate of the side draw from K23 was similar or even higher than reported in the Japanese paper. It is now very likely, that the following scenario happened: At around 13.28, when K23's bottom pump was stopped, the aqueous phase could flow into WBG2336 by displacing hot cumene. The aqueous phase from K23's side draw vessel BBG2305 had a temperature of around 70 C. Hot cumene was displaced and flowed to Tank 93, As already mentioned, this was indicated by the temperature increase from 109  C to 134  C by the indicator TR82374. After reaching this maximum at 13.39, the temperature dropped down to finally 106  C at 14.00. In maximum, the lower part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger could be filled up with the aqueous phase, what was around 155 liters. By initial gas formation from MHP decomposition, hydrogen could accumulate in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger. The aqueous phase could heat up in contact with the hot cumene and the hot steel from the heat exchanger, as well as by MHP decomposition, until it started to boil. The pressure in the heat exchanger was around 0.7 barg, coming from the backpressure of Tank 93. The boiling point of pure water at this pressure is 115 C. But as the aqueous phase contained light boilers like MHP, acetone and methanol, the boiling point was lower, probably around 106 C, which was finally indicated by TR82374. First the vapor could accumulate, besides hydrogen, in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger and then had to release to the line towards Tank 93. The initial MHP concentration in the aqueous phase from BBG2305 was probably below 3 %, as it was from normal operation of K23. After the incident the MHP concentration in BBG2305 was 28 %. It is assumed, that the mean concentration in the heat exchanger was finally 15 %, what is approximately the average of these two figures. By evaporating, the heat from MHP decomposition could initially be discharged, until the thermal explosion occurred. Due to heat removal by evaporation at the beginning, the effective MHP concentration, which finally caused a thermal explosion, was lower. Nevertheless, the gas formation from 6 % MHP is already sufficient to exceed a pressure of 15 barg, what caused the failure of the heat exchanger. Form the kinetics a runaway of a 15 % MHP solution occurs within 100 seconds, starting at 106 C. At a temperature of more than 115 C, the pressure increase over time from gas formation is higher than 10 bars per second. Such a high pressure gradient could not be compensated by a release of the gas towards Tank 93, because the inertia of the liquid in the long pipe was too high. Consequently the heat exchanger burst, as it could not withstand a pressure of more than 15 barg. Based on these investigations, a thermal explosion (runaway) of a higher concentrated MHP solution is the cause for the over pressurisation of the spiral heat exchanger WBG2336. process analysis design of plant/equipment/system isolation of equipment/system runaway reaction",

At the time of the accident, he was closing the manhole of the reactor after loading solid raw materials through the manhole. The manhole lid was blown off by the explosion in the reactor and hit the operator in the face. The operator died instantaneous. The manhole was found several meters from the reactor. The sprinklers in the production building were automatically activated by the fire in the reactor. Neighbouring equipment was slightly damaged due to projectiles from the explosion. The accident had no consequences for the environment or for the surroundings.Process descriptionThe reactor is the first step in the batch production of polyesteracrylates. In the reactor polyols are esterificated with acrylic acid. This endothermic reaction is operated at ambient pressure and at a temperature between 80 C and 120 C. The process exists of different consecutive steps in different equipment (reaction, washing, filtration, stripping and concentration) and needs many manual interventions by the operator. The installations are located in a closed building.The accident happened in the loading phase of the reactor, which consists of:- loading of liquid catalyst from an isobulkcontainer (IBC). It is sucked in the reactor by putting the reactor under vacuum. This is done manually at the reactor.- manual loading of small quantities of solid raw materials (prepared in buckets) through the manhole- loading of solvent (toluene) from the bulk tank (controlled by DCS)- loading of acrylic acid from a bulk storage tank (controlled by DCS).The reaction is controlled by the process computer (DCS) through the flow rate of acrylic acid and the temperature. The operator checks the pH of a sample of the reaction product to determine whether the reaction is completed. If so, the product is transferred to the wash vessel and the reactor is rinced with the solvent toluene, which is afterwards also added to the wash vessel.

According to the company, in the initial design this was judged to be necessary to assure the acrylic acid inhibitor to inhibit the undesired autopolymerisation of the acid. - Flammable substanceThe reactor is washed with toluene between two batches. After the washing, there are still toluene vapours present in the reactor. Calculations performed by the company before the accident estimate the concentration of the toluene/air mixture at approx. 5 vol%. Given the explosion limits of toluene of 1,2 vol% and 7 vol% at ambient temperature, the reactor contained an explosive toluene/air mixture in the gas phase when the operator was manually loading raw materials through the open manhole. The ignition of the toluene/air mixture is most likely due to an unwanted chemical reaction between the raw materials that were loaded manually through the manhole of the reactor. Laboratorium tests performed during the accident investigation identified a reaction between three of the five manually loaded solids. The heat production rate is low at ambient temperature but raises rapidly from 70 C on. At 90-100 C, a violent exothermic reaction occurs with the production of carbon oxide, carbon dioxide and phosphine. Phosphine autoignites at 100 C. The explosion was most likely an explosion of the toluene/air mixture in the reactor, ignited by the auto-ignition of phosphine. Because the solid materials are added to a nearly empty reactor (contained only 100 liter of liquid catalyst), they could accumulate at the reactor wall below the manhole. This wall is supposed to have been at a temperature around 80 C, since the previous batch was stopped at 80 C and based on evidence that the cooling was not turned on before the operator started the loading of the next batch. This means that the reactor wall was at a temperature very close to the start of the runaway reaction between the solids.The company claims that the normal operation was to load one third of the solvent before the manual addition of the additives. This would have avoided the accumulation of the solids to the reactor wall and hence the runaway reaction igniting the toluene vapour.However the loading sequence was not clearly defined in the batch cards and instructions. Furthermore, the process computer software was not in accordance with the sequence supposed to be followed by the operators. During the last 15 years, several modifications were introduced (E.g. loading the solvent in two steps to avoid splashing when adding solid catalyst and raw materials, change from solid to liquid catalyst). As a consequence, operators often only launched the new batch on the process computer after having loaded the catalyst and the solid raw materials. Since the cooling of the reactor is only automatically activated by the DCS once the start of a new batch is launched on the process computer, this deviation in the loading procedure implied that the reactor was not cooled during manual loading unless the operator started the cooling manually. The normal sequence implies an exposure to toluene vapours when loading the raw materials during the manhole. This exposure issue was formally identified by the company in risk and work place studies since 2001. Operators were supposed to wear breathing protection masks, but this was not formally and strictly imposed nor supervised. Due to the lack of clear batch cards and instructions and the lack of supervision by management, the loading sequence differed from shift to shift and even between operators of the same shift. As for the sequence followed by the victim, some of the operators intended to avoid toluene exposure - and thus the need of wearing a breathing mask - by adding the toluene after all the manual loading via the manhole. The risk study on the process was incomplete:- not all process steps were addressed (E.g. toluene washing of the reactor between two batches)- the explosion risk was not adequatly evaluated (only measures to avoid ignition source, no question whether oxygen was really needed during the loading phase)- the loading sequence was not investigated (was supposed to be correct and followed in practice)- not all risks were identified (dangerous reactions between raw materials, use of compressed air for the transfer of solvents between vessels).An incident in July 2003 on a similar reactor indicated possible dangerous reactions between the solid raw materials. The follow up of the conclusions of the incident investigation was insufficient. A project aiming addition of all raw materials with closed systems (hoppers) and working in lean air conditions was planned for implementation later in 2006. The organisational changes within the company over the last years significant influenced the delay in taking technical improvement measures. The establishment changed of legal entity mid 2004 with a view of being taken over by a worldwide group, with a freezing of investments as a consequence. The take over in 2005 lead to significant changes on management level and staffing. The safety management system, which was in process of being adapted to the SMS guidelines of the new group who took over the company, did not assure an evaluation of the impact on safety of this kind of organisational changes. management organization inadequate organized procedures process analysis design of plant/equipment/system runaway reaction",

Depending on their positions, product transfer from temporary storage is made to one of the conditioning units. Probably inadvertently, one of the valves was not completely closed on Monday 30th july. During pesticide transfer, a dash of product flowed through a flexible that was suspended above the collection system for waste water. Because of this, no odor and no leaking has been detected at the workplace. Activated carbon filters were rapidly saturated with the pollutants load in used waters. Waste water was not sufficiently purified before release into the river Meuse. Secondary causes :1) The person in charge of conditioning had noted that 800 liters of product were lacking compared to the client's order. But he didn't imagine that was due to a release. As there is a lack of communication between formulation and conditioning teams, the operator assumed that there was less product formulated and he must take the balance from reserve storage.2) A homogenisation bowl for waste water is placed after purifying unit ; but was bypassed due to works on it.3) The TCO meter used to control the quality of waste water before release should have raised an alarm.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On Saturday January 5th 2008 a production operator discovered a fair-sized phenol leak in the phenol pump house next to the phenol storage tank. One of the gaskets on the flange connection on the outlet pipe of the tank had failed. The head of the operations department tried to stop the leak by tying a rubber belt around the flanges. In the meantime, an operator sprayed lots of water on the flange to avoid contact with phenol as much as possible.The phenol that had leaked was collected in the catchment pit of 20 m# underneath the pump house. Afterwards the spray water was added to it. This catchment pit had a high level alarm, but that was not functioning at the time of the leak. The malfunctioning was not known by the company at that time because the alarm wasn't inspected periodically. An attempt was made to close the only manual valve on the pipe, located between the inner and the outer tank shells. But the valve broke off during this manipulation. So the line couldn't be shut off. After the temporary repair of the flange connection, three trickles of phenol kept on spraying, which were also collected in the catchment tank. It wasn't allowed for the employees to enter the pump house for as long as the phenol was leaking.To clean up the catchment pit, the company disposes of a waste tank, which is big enough to contain all leaked and leaking phenol. When starting to pump the phenol from the catchment tank to the waste tank, it was discovered that the catchment pit did overflow. Part of the phenol/water mixture had flown over the rim of the open pit into the municipal sewer system. At the time, it was not yet known how much phenol had leaked to the sewer system.On Monday January 7th 2008 it was decided to start up the phenol based batch production to consume all phenol in the storage tank as the phenol tank had to be taken out of service in order to replace the gasket on the flange. On Tuesday January 8th, after a few batch productions, it was found out that the level indicator in the phenol storage tank got stuck since the last control of the level on Friday 4th (comparison of manual level measurement with level indicator). Only at that moment the company realised how much phenol had leaked out of the tank: about 25 tonnes! Most of it should have been collected in the catchment pit, so it was recuperated. But a part of the phenol, more than 5 tonnes, got in the municipal sewer. As far as is known, there was no external damage reported.A specialised company came on site to repair the (remaining) phenol leak with a temporary, but solid solution. Afterwards, when the flanges and valves were replaced, it was found out that the valve broke down because the gasket next to it had been reacting with phenol during many years, leading to a solid deformation preventing the valve to move.

Since the day the phenol tank was taken into service, this valve had never been closed or inspected.- The automatic activation of the submerged pump by a level switch in the catchment tank didn't function. This level switch had never been tested in the past.- The level indicator in the phenol tank didn't function anymore.

The release reached beyond the boundary of the company. At 07:56 h a level III chemical alarm was issued. The release from the tank was stopped before 17:00 h by the fire service in cooperation with workers from the electrolysis operation. During this time 12 members of HZS were treated medically, with 10 of these being injured (inhalation, acid burn). No other workers at the plant or inhabitants of the surrounding area were harmed. The accident had no affect on the operation of the production plants.On the 21.7.2000 at 7:00 Mr Majer prepared, on the request of the head of the chlorine filling shop. Mr. Juris, the pumping of chlorine from tank 8 located in building E 4990 to an external tank. After performing the necessary manipulation and checking the operational parameters of the tank he switched on the pump in tank 8. At that point he heard a loud bang, and saw that the store was inundated with chlorine, whereby he switched off the pump. On the basis of the reaction of sensor no. 5 of the emergency monitoring system (a signal is lead to the electrolysis control panel of the operational headquarters of the fire services) at 7:49, it is possible to estimate the time of accident as approx. 7:45. Obrat informoval Mr. Juris and together dressed in protective masks they investigated what had happened. Due to the heavy inundation of chlorine Mr. Juris returned to the adjacent building for breathing equipment. He then informed Mr. Kubist, manager of the chlorine, lye and ATA production, who at 7:52 called for the fire services (extension 150). After entering the inundated storage area, Mr. Juris attempted to determine the source of the leakage. He discovered that the liquid chlorine was leaking from the top of tank 8, where the pump was located. He supposed that the chlorine delivery route from the pump was broken, as the leak occurred at the moment the pump was turned on.In difficult conditions and with minimal visibility he closed the armature of the delivery pump above the lid of the tank and opened the armature of the deaeration tank to the chlorine production. He then left the storage area and switched off the storage area ventilation system. In the meantime, Mr. Kubista activated the emergency shutdown in the sodium chloride production hall. The fire services arrived at 7:55 am. A third degree chemical alarm was sounded at 7:56 am. At this time wind direction was 278  (westerly) and velocity was 0.5 m/s. The fire services began their investigation at 8:00 am and began to take action to limit the leakage of chlorine from the tank. At the same time, Mr. Stastny switched off the electricity in building E 4990. The tenzometric scales and pressure and temperature measurements of the chlorine tanks in the store ceased to operate. After the arrival of the fire services, Mr. Juris and Mr. Kubista briefed them on the severity of the situation and that the liquid chlorine is probably leaking from the pump's feed pipe in tank 8. In light of the fact that after closing the delivery vent of the pump the intensity of the leak did not decrease, they deduced that the pipe ruptured somewhere between the lid of the tank and the delivery armature, where there is a special steel profile.. The fire services managed, under conditions of very poor visibility and spraying liquid chlorine, to directly identify the leakage point. On the basis of the third degree chemical alarm and the information given by NES -OkU Meln\u00edk, vyhl\u00e1sil NES the warning signal Catastrophe and subsequently announced that there had been a release of chlorine at Spolena over the public relay system in the town of Tisice-Kozly at 8:32.

        "causes_description": "causes:  A physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. Failure of pump motor in the tank.The cause of the accident was a physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine, initiated by sepnut\u00ed of the electrical circuit.The explosion was preceded by penetration of liquid chlorine into the stator parts of the pump motor through a hole in the protective membrane of the stator with subsequent chemical degradation of the material and loss of the insulation properties of the conductors.A short-circuit occurred in the in the stator parts of the pump motor near the protective membrane, which was made of Hastelloa material, on the 20.7.2000, as a consequence of the loosening of several conductors, initiated by a chemical reaction with the chlorine. The protective membrane was exposed to high temperatures for a period of up to 12 seconds (time period until electrical protection reacted) and subsequently perforated. Then the electrical current was lost thereby shutting down the electrical protection. The reaction was subsequently inhibited by the impact of the presence of a large volume of liquid chlorine. Liquid chlorine entered the stator coil and protective tubing of the feed conductors through the perforation in the stator protective membrane.Due to the shutting down of the pump on the 21.7.2000 there was an electrical and temperature overload, caused by a spontaneous reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. The sharp increase in temperature and the subsequent pressure (approx. 70 - 100 MPa) caused the explosion. The speed of the explosion cancelled out the effectiveness of the electrical protection. The upper tube of the pump motor was lifted and with a slight delay caused a pressure shock and the energy of the released gaseous chlorine caused the horizontal parts of the tubing of the feed conductors to break. Analysis of the quality of the welded joint indicated a clean break, without material defect, fatigue or corrosive damage.This resulted in the ejection of the remains of this tubing with the terminal block on the profile support of the flooring below the tank. The liquid chlorine then escaped from the tank to the collection sump no. 8. component/machinery failure/malfunction",

These reactions increased the temperature on the interface up to the decomposition temperature of nitrobenzene. Thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene was accompanied by a rupture of the storage tank - explosion. An investigation team was appointed in accordance with the operational guidelines of BC MCHZ - Instruction M2 - 26150.doc Investigation of extraordinary events. Results of the investigation are summarized in the report Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river.

The released propylene created a gas cloud that was ignited 4 minutes later, causing un unconfined gas cloud explosion and a large fire. The overpressure generated by the deflagration caused the breakage of numerous windows panes inside the establishment.

A distillation column (9m high) was broken and crashed with other nearby columns. The substances contained in vessels and pipelines were released resulting in a large fire that, one and a half hour later, was under control. The fire was extinguished on January 27, at 01:00 a.m. Inside the establishment 43 people were injured and 7 people were hospitalized.

On the day of the accident the dispersion feeding pipe was blocked by solidified lithium metal. To unblock the pipe, a wooden stick was used to push (to avoid sparks and any damage to the reactor's enamel). After removal of a blind flange, the valve on the cleaning nipple was filled with paraffin (prior the reactor and the connected piping were depressurized). The wooden stick used for pushing was wrapped with a piece of cloth soaked in paraffin and the piece of cloth was put over the opened valve in such a way that the reactor should be protected against air entry. As the blockage was unusually solid, it could not be removed by pushing. During the attempt to remove the solidified lithium, the lithium dispersion was released through the ring slot between the wooden stick and the cleaning valve and seeped under the paraffinated piece of cloth on the reactor and ignited spontaneously. The worker on the operation platform above the reactor was burned on nose and neck by the jet-fire; the worker in front of the reactor was not hurt. Both workers run quickly to the control room and activated the alarm as they were not able to avoid the spreading fire on a second platform. The first fire was fed by the continuing release of lithium/diehtylether dispersion (it has been estimated that about 700 litres of lithium/diethylether were released). Due to the strong evolution of heat, synthetic materials caught fire: cables, lamp covers, a light globe and finally the tar board cover of the beton roof. The sudden unexpected release of the lithium dispersion from the cleaning valve can be explained as a manipulation error. The inlet valve in the reactor as well as the lateral outlet valve from the dispersion tank were not closed from the beginning of this otherwise routine executed cleaning operation. As the wooden stick was in the cleaning valve it was impossible to close this valve.

The full volume of the vessel was usually reduced from 5600 to 3000 kg. As required by the short distance of the tanks from the service building. For this it was installed a new gas extraction valve with integrated overfilling safety system. The modification works were carried on by two mechanics of a skilled company. An employee of the company helped in the modification works. The container was mostly discharged and should only be emptied of the residue and then cleaned. For this, neither safety devices were used nor the residue gas was flamed. Instead of this the injection and extraction pipes were disflanged, so that the out flowing gas escaped until the gas overpressure exhausted. In order to withdrawn the residue gas still in the tank, this was filled with water, which was pumped in the tank by an electrical dipping-pump from the near available flow.The motor integrated in the immersion pump was supplied by a current elongation cable which was inserted in a socket of the service structure. During throwing in of the immersion pump and with this filling of the vessel with water the back pressure was so strong, that the mechanics (workers) could no more support the tube and the employees of the company solicited the plug of the elongation cable to draw out, in order to shut down the immersion pump.

In these rooms the foam extinguishing equipment and the electric operation equipment pertaining to the storage of mineral oil products are kept. According to the indications of the operator, chemicals, solvents and similar substances were not stored in the cellar rooms. Investigations on the premises established that between the basement of the office building and the tank storage hollow pipes, housing electric leads for the tank storage, were laid underground. In the particular case there are two lines of several hollow pipes each which lead from the basement of the office-building towards the tank storage and end under a platform. Also several hollow pipes coming from the vault manholes of the underground tanks end in this area. Electric cables are laid too in these hollow pipes to the vault manholes. The inspection established that none of these hollow pipes was sealed. Measurements during the investigation on the premises found explosive mixtures in the connecting pipes between the vault manhole and the platform as well as in the area under the platform even several days after the explosion. It has to be assumed that the explosion was caused by explosive mixtures which could reach the basement of the office-building through the unsealed hollow pipes and ignited there through the burner of the heating-installation. Six persons were injured through the explosion and had to be hospitalised. Consistent material loss was caused. Two persons claimed for damages. Measurement of the Fire-brigade at the fire source indicated higher concentrations of benzene, toluene, and hexane. Toluene and hexane are stored in the tank storage, whereas benzene is not. Due to the dimensions of the explosions it has to be assumed that a large amount of explosive mixture had to be involved. It is not clear which kind of chemicals were released and led to the explosion. However there is no evidence of overflowing or leakage of chemicals. No over-ground leakage could be found in the tank installation. On the basis of the investigations leakages in the underground piping system or in the underground tanks cannot be excluded.

The plant produced 15.6 tonnes chlorine/h and was in normal conditions. There were no evident deviations from the safe operating mode. At the time of the disturbance (accident, failure, breakdown) the shift was manned with a regular crew of 9 persons. The person charged with the control of the measurements was informed by an acoustic signal that a short circuit had occurred in one of the cells. This occurrence is not exceptional and is generally caused by a slight pressure fluctuation in the hydrogen system, which is passed back through the sloping connection between the hydrogen and the chlorine sections. Searching the cause of the increased hydrogen pressure, the controller found immediately out that the hydrogen compressor, which removes all hydrogen from the plant, broke down. He then tried to restart the compressor, which succeeded in the first instance. But short time afterwards, the aggregate broke down again. It is assumed that the low-pressure blocking system caused the break down of the aggregate. The crew observed at that time that a considerable release of hydrogen occurred from the small pipes of the amalgam decomposers. The reason of it is a not sufficient discharge of hydrogen over roof passing through a hydraulic guard foreseen for such cases. This hydraulic guard was set on 70 mm water level and transports the hydrogen without danger over the roof. The container is laid out in accordance with such cases. On the day of the operational disturbance, however, the function of the safety devices was limited (which was not recognized), because a non-irrelevant dirt deposition had formed inside, which increased the counter pressure. Hydrogen reached the cell-space through the mercury pump, which transfers the regenerated mercury again in the electrolytic cell. This fast and massive intrusion of hydrogen caused at least locally the formation of an explosive mixture. The first heavy explosion destroyed a part of the cells as well as the chlorine collection pipe of the new cell-block passing under the explosion point. The plant was shut down by emergency shut down by the crew immediately after the explosion. The after production of hydrogen due to the automatically ongoing decomposition of the amalgam present during that time was not affected by that. Following that, another heavy explosion occurred, which destroyed the externally passing chlorine collection pipe. False False False False",

The damages to the plant and to buildings are large. The preliminary investigation of the state criminal investigation agency could not identify the cause of the explosion. For this reason an expert agency was engaged. A clear cause could not be identified even through the experts, only a most probable cause could be determined. According to that, the explosion was caused by the release of gas from a ruptured hosepipe or a loose plug-in fitting. Hosepipes and plug-in fittings showed evidence of serious pre-existing damages. It can be assumed that either a porous hosepipe ruptured or that a plug in fitting got loose. As a report of the company proves, in particular the smaller and the older hoses were in a very bad condition. The internal rubber hose was porous and the external wire mesh in part defective. The same applied to the plug in fittings. The internal part of the plug in fittings was very dirty with a fatty grease, which in part was even encrusted (degraded component). This could have allowed a plug in fitting to get loose. The typology of the damages corresponds to the assumed cause of damage. It can be assumed that the explosion did occur in the firing chamber but instead in the intermediate roof (cooling channel). Furthermore, it is likely that the released gas was aspirated through the grid of the air intakes in the roof of the tunnel furnace and from there pulled backwards through the intermediate roof, were it mixed with air and formed thus the explosive mixture. The temperature in the cooling channel was of 127 degrees Celsius, which was not high enough for the ignition of the air/gas mixture. However the mixture could ignite in the range of the metal holders of the suspended roof or also be ignited by air pouring through leaks (cracks) in the suspended roof.

This hydrogen induced cracking has been originated by the geometric form variation and the resulting plastic deformation in the area of (in correspondence of) the damaged longitudinal seam (weld). This incipient cracking was favoured by the high tensile (strength) austenitic CrNiMnW weld metal with its particularly accentuated martensitic composite (mixed) zone (area) along the transition between weld metal and basis metal and was also favoured by its physical characteristics which differ strongly from the basis metal.

The explosion occurred on the bottom-side (under-side) of the drag-chain conveyor. The returning drag-chains are coated and form with the bottom of the trough an essentially closed room (space). The conveyor has the function to transport fuel, mainly in the form of chips and pieces of wood, from a bulk pit (hole) to the combustion chamber. The fuel is fed, in correspondence of the supply (transfer) point, in the combustion chamber through a lock (gate). The actual cause of the explosion (accident root cause) could not yet be identified. Probably the explosion was ignited through a flame-transmission from the furnace. In principle it is possible that an ignition source has penetrated in the drag-chain conveyor from the bulk pit or the combustion chamber. The possibility that the ignition source originated from the bulk pit can be excluded, considering the fact that the fuel was frozen due to the low external temperatures, and that it is very unlikely that the frozen fuel ignites (catches fire). The ignition source could have been transmitted from the furnace, even if the fuel is fed through a lock. Due to the rough (harsh) operation conditions it is plausible that the lock-flaps did not close tight. It is also plausible that the explosion occurred in the combustion chamber or that the under-pressure control was disturbed.Four persons doing repair works on a filter in the direct vicinity of (immediately near) the drag-chain-conveyor were injured by the explosion. Two persons could be sent home from hospital after ambulant treatment, whereas the two other persons had to be hospitalised for a longer period due to the burns on their faces.The paneling of the drag-chain-conveyor was ripped off by the explosion.Wood dust-explosion (deflagration of wood-dust) in a combustion installation False False False False dust explosion",

The liquid gas feed pumps were inoperative too, so that at the external temperature conditions (approx. -5 C ) the pressure on the overflow valve was only the static pressure of the liquid gas pipe. Therefore the overflow valve opening function was not activated.The characteristics of the damage (a crack with a length of 12 mm in the longitudinal direction of the bellows) together with an evaluation of the local situation as well as the situation in the establishment indicate that the most probable cause is a imperfect manufacture or a defect in the material. component/machinery failure/malfunction",

Therefore, according to the process a suspension was conveyedover a clarification press to the coupling kettle. Since the press wasfull, the content (about 50%) was transferred into a vat. The remaining50% was filtered at the beginning of the morning shift, and remained inthe clarification press.During the morning shift, superiors found that the precipitate was notthe expected residue of the amine, containing sulphur, but a largequantity of the diazo. Therefore, immediately instructions were issuedto wash the coupling kettle and the clarification press with water, andto soak with water the transferred residue. During the inspection ofthe clarification press in the morning, about 2 kg of the material fellto the ground.Since dry diazonium salts decompose immediately in case of mechanicalblows or friction, it must be assumed that a part of the residuedecomposed because of mechanical stress, which caused as a consequencethe explosion of the main part of the residue in the tub.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The bromine release was caused by a pipe connection which had not been closed.At the beginning of the transfer operation, after passing the highest point of the pipe, the bromine flowed under normal atmospheric pressure, as a small stream, down to the junction point, hitting a blind shutter, which was attached to a neighbouring valve. Immediately after the bromine release, a watchman activated the emergency stop. The shut-off valve closed within approx. 3 s. Only that part of the bromine was released which had already passed the highest point of the pipe.The bromine was collected by bottom containment system. After 30-40 s the fire fighting team could stop the evaporation of the bromine by covering the bromine with a layer of water.At 13:46, another alarm was released.The pipe section between the highest point of the pipe and the rail tanker was still filled with bromine. It is not known whether at this time any bromine had already penetrated into the double wall jacket. The leak check pipe ruptured. The leak was sealed with a blind flange (seal plate). 5-10 l of bromine were released, while due to the immediate measures taken by the fire fighting team abatement of the vapour) only a small fraction of the bromine was dispersed in the air.The released bromine was caught together with the water in the rail spill-containment system and in the containment system of the neighbouring hydrochloric acid tanks, so that it was not absorbed by the ground.In the meantime, the pressure in the rail tanker was reduced using a gas washer of a lithium bromide installation. Almost no bromine was released during this process. Subsequently, the remaining content of the inner pipe of the double wall pipe was transferred into the rail tanker. This reduced the hazards. According to a worst case scenario, at his time there were still ca. 30 l of bromine in the double wall jacket.The bromine inside the wagon was strongly heated by the sun shining on the black PE (polyethylene) double wall pipe. There was the risk of a rupture of the PE box near the shut-off valve. An attempt to reduce the pressure on the emptying valve before a receiving arm by shortly opening was aborted, because of the high temperature of the bromine a strong spontaneous evaporation occurred. Massive use of water avoided the diffusion of bromine vapour. After this emptying through a pipe connecting piece was chosen. Since mechanical strength (resistance) was not granted during the whole duration of the operation, additionally a funnel was placed underneath. During opening of the valve the pipe connecting piece broke off. Subsequently, the double jacket was washed with sodium sulphate solution. During this operation, there was a minor release of bromine, because a blind flange (seal pipe) had to be opened.",

The feeding control was set on manual operation which according to experience creates the feeding conditions foreseen by the operating instructions (manual).Between 11:00 and 11:30 hrs there were three heating gas breakdowns (failures of the supply), due to the fact that a too high heating gas pressure released the corresponding shut-off of the supply. The heating gas supply was restarted each time. About 12:33 hrs. alarms signaled raised temperatures of the reaction-tube walls. It was attempted to reduce the temperature by increasing the EDC (1,2-dichloroethane) feed.About 12:39 hrs temperature alarm was released for the pyrolysis gas (cracking gas) and a further raise in the temperatures of the reaction-tube walls. Around 12:44 the extinguishing of furnace flames was started. The EDC feed was increased further. At 12:52 hrs another temperature alarm was released for the pyrolysis gas (cracking gas). At 12:58 the heating gas was shut-off completely.Although the tube-wall temperatures were decreasing since 12:50 hrs, with the exception of the temperatures at the coil-end (worm end), the pyrolysis-gas transfer pipe between the furnace and the cooler burst. The released pyrolysis gas ignited immediately.EDC feed-valves were shut-off. Back-flowing EDC from a quencher fed the fire. operator error",

After the part of the installation affected had been identified and isolated, it was decided to let the naphtha burn out under control, while nitrogen was used to push out the residual naphtha from the equipment.The cause of the event was probably linked to maintenance works on a cracking furnace.In order to clean out the coke deposited inside the cracking tubes as a consequence of the reaction mechanisms, the smaller cracking furnaces have to be shut-down every 60 days. The coke is then burnt into CO2 through controlled feeding of water vapour and air into the cracking tubes.Before this operation, the cracking tubes must be thoroughly flushed to remove any hydrocarbon residues, after which the cracking tubes must be safely separated from the naphtha system. To do this, besides shutting off the valves, blanking plates are placed in the inlets of the furnace.In the case being considered, this switch-over of furnaces was being carried out. The required work was carried out by a team. A blanking plate plan in the control room documents the extraction and the placing of blanking plates . In the beginning, the team correctly followed the sequence of procedures required by the operating instructions and the plan. However, it appears that the release occurred, a blanking plate from a nearby pressurised naphtha pipe was extracted instead of a blanking plate from the pipe leading to the furnace which had to be decoked. The released overheated liquid vaporised spontaneously and caught fire within a few seconds upon contact with an adjacent furnace.",

A clearly detectable foam layer had formed and had released the overflow protection alarm.About 30 l of phosphoric acid added immediately for stabilisation, had no apparent effect. Next, a valve was closed between the first tank and an adjacent tank connected to it, and the first tank's contents was drained into a secondary containment basin. At the same time, the drained hydrogen peroxide was diluted with water, and the vapours were abated. In addition, the tank was externally cooled with water.Because of the risks for the emergency response team, the drainage had to be stopped. In spite of the measures taken, the temperature was still rising.Around 17:30, a fountain-like jet of hydrogen peroxide erupted from an open manhole. While the emergency response team started to withdraw the tank burst, the remaining hydrogen peroxide was dispersed over a large surface. 10 members of the fire brigade suffered skin burns. Most of the hydrogen peroxide was deposited within a distance of 30 m, and was then diluted and washed away with water (transitory storage in the emergency retention basin). A minor quantity of hydrogen peroxide came down beyond the perimeter of the plant as a droplet cloud, in the neighbourhood of the plant. As a preventive measure, the population was alerted.Cause: Probably the hydrogen peroxide was contaminated by alkaline process solution, which initiated the decomposition reaction. As a possible pathway, a ventilation pipe of a ring line was identified as possible inlet point. This ventilation pipe leads to a decanter, used for a safe drainage of hydrogen peroxide in case of release. If the drain line of the decanter gets obstructed, the filling level in the decanter can rise significantly submerging the ventilation pipe with process solution. Considerable quantities of the process solution can therefore flow back into the tank without being detected. runaway reaction Yes",

The doors of the filling station building were still open, because the tightness control, which according to the standard procedure must be carried out with chlorine gas originating from the storage tank, had not yet been performed.Cause: Because of the incorrect operation, the liquid chlorine valve was erroneously activated too early. The resulting pressure surge in the filling pipeline (the connecting valve between the filling pipeline and the storage tank was still shut), caused the failure of the gasket on the slip-on connecting flange between the tank wagon and the filling pipeline, which led to the liquid chlorine spill. operator error",

Ice melting released ammonia in the drainage system during the following days. This was noticed by a contractor on 15 December 1998, due to the ammonia smell.The safety systems of the installation did not trigger off, due to the fact that the pipe was out of service with closed valves.

Apparently a part of the pentane had penetrated directly into the ground in correspondence with the tanks through fissures between the manholes of the underground tanks and their collars.According to the information given by the company, about 14.000 litres of n-pentane are missing. It is difficult to estimate how much of it evaporated and how much penetrated in the ground. According to the investigation and to the measurements, it has to be assumed that several thousand litres of pentane penetrated in the ground. On 1/03/00 a release of Pentane occurred on a feeding pipe of a foam production plant.During normal operation of the installation, a leak occurred in a corrugated hose connecting a pump to the fixed piping.The gas detection system apparently did not respond or, at least, according to the declarations of the employees, no acoustic or optical alarm was perceived. The pump did not switch off automatically even with 40% LEL of pentane gas.Due to the failure of the safety systems, pentane was released without being detected in the pump manhole and, from there, it diffused into the inspection manholes of the underground tanks connected to the pump manhole.When the damage was detected, the pump manhole and the manholes of the underground tanks were already filled with pentane; pentane had already reached the pavement of courtyard and evaporated.

The damaged corrugated hose was exactly fitted (exact length) between the transfer pump and the fixed piping. The lifting movement of the pump exposed the corrugated hose to a continuous mechanical strain. The substitution of the corrugated hose was scheduled once a year and the hose concerned had been operating for 8 months.The gas-sensor had not been damaged by the release and it was perfectly functional.",

Moreover, certain amounts of dry p-NA penetrated into the suction pipe and formed deposits inside it. Consequent to the formation of NO2 during diazotation, the incrustations on the steam pipe and in the exhaust system were transformed into a more reactive product.Tests have shown that exposing solidified p-NA surfaces (having a similar consistency of p-NA incrustations) to NO2 gas, leads to the formation of an extremely reactive product.On 11/05/00 a fire occurred in a dyes synthesis plant.In the plant in question, p-nitroaniline (p-NA) is diazotated. The diazotation reaction occurs in an iced hydrous solution, sodium nitrite (in hydrous solution) and hydrochloric acid (34%) are used as diazotation agents. During the diazotation reaction, nitrous gases are released and sent, together with the hydrochloric acid vapours, to the alkaline absorption through a piping system.During the start-up operations of the apparatus for a new synthesis process, an empty container (18,5 m3) had to be cleaned with pre-heated water added with a sodium hydroxide solution (approx. 200 l).After filling the container to approximately 2/3 of its volume, low pressure vapour was blown into the container by opening a manual valve. The steam is fed through a pipe directly into the cleaning solution. The liquid phase as well as the pipe-walls which are not covered by the liquid heat up, temperatures expected are around 100 C.A few minutes after the steam feeding started, the operator observed the appearance of a flame which moved towards the suction opening. Shortly afterwards (a few minutes), flames accompanied by detonating sounds appeared in the suction pipe. Immediately after, the suction pipe completely burnt with a flash-like fire. The operator declared, moreover, that during diazotation reaction large amounts of nitric oxides are released and that during the last 10 start-ups large amounts of dust occurred during dosage because of the use of dry p-NA. Dust was aspirated and penetrated into the suction system.",

A short circuit exposed the exhaust air pipe (above the defective fluorescent tube), linked to the ventilation system of the equipment, to thermal stress.

The exhaust air ventilator on fifth floor pulled the fire upstairs overriding the fire dampers.On 06/07/00 a fire occurred in an intermediate ceiling of the second floor of the installation in question.The professional fire brigade and the onsite firefighting service were notified at the same time. The fire was extinguished rapidly and was declared extinguished.During the subsequent control smoke was detected at the door on the second floor leading to the ventilation shaft. After opening the door it appeared that a fire was spreading rapidly towards the ventilation control station in the fifth floor.On the roof of the five storey building the openings of the ventilation system are located.In the north-eastern zone of the building (contact area with the neighbouring building) the development of strong smoke was detected. The smoke cloud was approximately 150-300 m high and shifted slowly towards north-east (an industrial park area).Measurements were performed around 07:25. The measurements were focused on the detection of HCN, HCL, and ammonia gases in the immediate surroundings of the burning building. All measurements were negative.On request of the Environmental Protection Agency (Umweltbundesamt), the measurements were repeated at 08:25. The measurements at the adjoining industrial park resulted in a HCL gas concentration of 20 ppm. The ERPG-2 threshold limit was therefore exceeded and the D3-notification level was released. Due to the wind direction, at no stage was the population exposed to risk. However, there was a health hazard for the employees of the industrial park, due to the high HCL gas concentration.The fire was under control around 10:00 hrs, at 11:15 hrs it was extinguished.

This caused a releasein the environment of approximately 500 kg of liquid gas from theroad-tanker through the leakage source.The investigation showed that constructive defects in the safety-breakcoupling with predetermined breaking zone (DN 80, PN 25) caused theoccurrence.- the M6 connection-screws of both coupling-halves were not secured.There was neither an elastic ring, a cotter pin or a locknut installed.-The screws were loose, this allowed the formation of a fissure betweenboth coupling-halves, which caused the liquid gas release.- Screwheads and nuts did not lay-on flat but exceeded the curvature ofthe bottleneck, such that there was not a smooth supporting surface.",

The over-charge with maleic anhydride caused an exothermic decomposition reaction of maleic anhydride, during the continuation of the charging operations.

The additional pressure increase caused the bursting of the manhole cover with the release of decomposition gaes and of the substances contained in the reactor. The substances ignited and led to a confined explosion with a consequent fire, causing the destruction of a part of the installation.On 12/10/00 an explosion with a consequent fire occurred in a synthetic resin production plant.The accident investigation showed, that a run-away reaction due to faulty charging of the reactor caused the occurrence. Besides an unperceived faulty command of the the process control system (PCS) by the operator, the expert appointed identified an insufficient default setting or a faulty design of the PCS as the cause of the faulty charging of the reactor. The software or the design of the PCS was not apt to recognise safety-relevant faulty commands and to prevent the execution of these commands. design of plant/equipment/system instrument/control/monitoring-device failure",

Approximately 90 minutes elapsed after the change from nitrogen to atmospheric air before Sokalan ignited, due to the fact that the dryer temperature on the cold side of the heat-exchanger was below 160 C. At low ambient temperatures Sokalan starts oxidising slowly, so that a certain amount of time elapses before ignition.Burning Sokalan was then transported by the gas stream into the dryer. The substance was first redirected by the so-called  Chinese hat collector to the bottom part of the dryer. Up to 40 kg Ludigol (m-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt CAS-Nr.: 127-68-4) dust from the closed loop dryer gas had deposited in that space. The burning sokalan met the ludigol dust inducing it's decomposition. The ludigol fire expanded over the dust layer towards the fluidised bed where another 40-50 kg ludigol decomposed. The fast accelerating uncontrolled decomposition reaction increased the pressure, despite the gas release through the rupture disk, causing the dryer shell to burst at a internal pressure of approximately 1.5 bar. loss of process control",

At 7:30 h the motor of one of the fresh air fans of the steam-generator had to be shut down due to operating problems. When the spare air fan was connected, the control valves opened, the lambda value of the combustion process no longer met the set values causing the automatic shut-down of the steam boiler. During start-up operations of the steam boiler a supply shortage of steam at 110 bar occurred causing the shut-down of one of the steam fed raw gas compressors. The excess steam had to be directed to a flare for approximately one hour.At 14:00 h the electricians requested the start-up of the repaired air fan motor for functional testing. The fact that the control valves of the fan were directly coupled to the rotational speed of the motor and not to the rotational speed of the fan was not taken into consideration This caused a recurrence of the situation that had occurred in the morning. Due to the fact that the steam boiler could not be started up in time the excess raw gas had to be directed again to the flare.Additional steam equipment operating on steam had to be shut-down in order to stabilise the high pressure steam supply situation, e.g. all steam fed boiler water pumps were shut-down. Out of 5 boiler water pumps only 2 pumps remained operative, which was sufficient for the existing loadAt 14:30 h in one of the boiler water pumps a 6 kV arc over occurred between power supply and pump motor, causing the failure of that pump.With only one pump functioning, the feed water supply of the last operating boiler was no longer guaranteed.The last steam generator was shut down when the signal feed water level to low was displayed. This led to the emergency shut-down of the last operating pyrolysis furnace; the shut down of the ground flare and the operation of the high-flare without steam injection. Operating the high-flare without steam significantly increased soot emissions with respect to normal operation. The high-flare was fed from then onwards with the evaporating refrigerants (ethylene, propylene) from the refrigeration circuits mixed with residual substances present in the refrigerated part of the ethylene plant.During a walk round the plant at approximately 17:30 the plant personnel noticed flames spreading from the furnace and alerted the on-site fire-brigade.

On 31.12.2001 the oxygen flow was again switched from the by-pass line to the product pipe with the aim of directing the oxygen into the storage tank. Before starting oxygen storage operations the product pipe had to be cleaned, due to the fact that the product pipe had not been used for a certain period of time and that contamination could not be excluded. The cleaning operation was performed by flushing the pipe with the product (oxygen). Due to the fact that the valve did not close correctly, oxygen was released over the pipe into the gravel bed near the tank and into the atmosphere instead of flowing into the oxygen storage tank.Switching from the by-pass line to the product pipe was made over a remote control from the control room of the other air separation unit. The monitoring system showed the opening of the flush valve and the closing of the valve after 2,5 min. In reality the flush valve was not closed. Oxygen spread over the site and it has to be assumed that it reached also the administration building at a distance of approximately 50 metres.At 16:55 h a fire broke out inside the building and an employee was killed.The fire destroyed most rooms on the ground floor and on the first floor of the building.The fire detectors responded in rapid sequence, it has therefore to be assumed that the fire spread very rapidly. The fire brigade brought the fire rapidly under control and extinguished it.A collaborator was inside the building when the fire broke out because one of the plant operators had requested him to check directly on-site the alarm signal released by an analysing device. The analyser indicated an oxygen content in the nitrogen cooling circuit near to the threshold value of 0,3 ppm. A defect in the analyser was suspected.The collaborator instructed to check the analysis came into the installation at 16:00 and controlled the corresponding analysis. He contacted the control room communicating that no errors could be found and his intention to leave the installation.Shortly after the fire detectors responded.The oxygen content measurement in the nitrogen cooling circuit of the air separator is an essential control parameter for the cooling process. The values measured do not give any clue with regards to the oxygen content of the ambient air in the surroundings. False False False False gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air",

The gasesare stored there until delivery.Air separation is a continuous process (rectification), therectification process always produces the above mentioned gases. It isnot possible to stop the production of one of these gases when theplant is operating. The plant was running on oxygen-production, whenthe accident occurred.Known causes: According to present knowledge the oxygen release was caused by the flush valve which was not closed correctly. For the time being it has to be assumed that the flush valve remained open for approximately 8 hours and that during that period of time oxygen was released in the environment instead of flowing into the storage tank. Probably the pneumatic valve, which was opened by compressed air, did not close correctly because the relief pipe for the expansion of the compressed air was iced up, due to atmospheric conditions and did not allow the compressed air to expand.The display on the control monitor indicated erroneously that the valve was closed not allowing the personnel to identify the failure.Investigation showed that the valve was not equipped with an end point control device. The display on the monitor was not given by the real position of the flush valve, but by the set flush time. The display on the valve position changes from open to closed after a set flushing time has lapsed. The real position of the flush valve was not monitored. With the existing monitoring system it was not possible to detect that the valve was not correctly closed.The icing of the compressed air relief pipe of the flush valve was probably due to an insufficient sizing of the pipe cross-section. Humidity could not be sufficiently discharged, adhering water droplets did not dissolve due to cohesion phenomena. The compressed air could not expand due to the icing of the relief pipe and the flush valve did not close correctly.The main accident cause was the control system set-up.Cause classification: atmospheric conditions (icing of the relief pipe), incomplete control of the flush valve position.",

Consequent to this event an employee was fatally injured. At the time of the occurrence the dosage system was undergoing technical modifications with the goal of increasing the dosage range of formaldehyde. The modification consisted in adding two ball valves to the two existing control valves in order to increase the technical safety of the system. To perform the modification disassembling of the two existing control valves and of partial pipe sections was necessary.An employee was given the job of preparing the disassembling operation by disconnecting the pneumatic and the electric connections from the valve bodies and installing the connections for the pneumatic and electric control of the new ball valves.These operations were prepared correctly and partially performed. At the time of the occurrence one of the control valves still had to be installed and consequently the pneumatic and electrical control systems were not connected.The point in which the valve was to be installed was not sealed.Approximately 30 litres of a 93% phenol-water solution at 508 C were released by an operational error of the employee, who activated via a function switch the opening and closing of a pneumatic ball valve in the phenol dosage section.

It was used in an air separation plant and for many years had only been used occasionally as a back up to the turbo compressor during peak load. The piston compressor had been switched on the previous day at 7.45 pm. It had therefore been on for approximately 16 hours at the time of accident. At 11.48 am strong vibrations were first observed, directly followed by an explosion at the compressor with a secondary fire. The machine shop was damaged as a result of the shock wave, projected parts, molten material, heat and fume condensation. There was no personal injury. False False False False",

This is clear from the damage: dismantling of the system confirmed the first impression.A metal fire must then have developed inside which spread by exploding outwards having melted the top wall of the cylinder. The fire was then apparently further fed by the oxygen flowing back out of the pipes until the stop valve of the pipe system was closed manually. There was evidence that the piston in stage 3 had jammed (piston rod twisted). It is likely that this seizure was a result of the primary cause, i.e. the piston got stuck and the piston rod was twisted as a result of the continued running (or trail ) of the machine.The presumed cause is that parts inside the compressor broke up or off and then gathered on the piston. These broken parts were then beaten against the cover of the compressor compartment and consequently became warped, or alternatively got into the gap between the piston and the cylinder liner (also possible for parts bigger than the width of the gap around the valve opening) and were ground there. Both of these processes produce friction heat which ignited the fire.",

The whole building was divided into several fire compartments. This safety measure, combined with the prompt action of the plant fire brigade, prevented the fire from spreading beyond the southern part of the building. The fire was discovered whilst a textile dye was being produced during the night shift in the vicinity of filter presses 3 and 4, which were both installed in one room on the second floor. According to a member of staff who was involved in and supervising production of the dye, the manufactured raw product was being pressed/washed with dimethylacetamide solvent (DMCA) in filter press 4 when he noticed naked flames coming from the filter press area. As filter press 3 was not in use, there is probably a link between the fire and the use of filter press 4. An explosion or a bang, which would indicate an explosive reaction or a deflagration, was not heard. Furthermore, it was asserted that one of the two fluorescent lamps fitted above filter press 4 was faulty and was no longer lit.

The sparks, generated by a scraper, probably reached the paper rolling machine forming smouldering nests in a base-paper roll which was being processed. The roll was then transferred into the fully automatic operated storage installation, the so-called Jumbo roll storage. The storage installation contained approximately 1800 tons of base-paper rolls for the production of paper towels.Later on smoke was noticed by workers of the processing department; the search in the processing department and the storage installation allowed to identify a smouldering paper roll.

Following completion of this work, there was a 3-pole earthedshort circuit at 4.14 pm due to a mistake by a REW worker whilstreconnecting disconnected components. One of the three power supplynetworks in the plant failed as a result. Gas turbine 1 in the southRWE power station, which is necessary for establishing an insularsupply within the plant, unexpectedly failed 180 milliseconds after theshort circuit. This was the result of a malfunction in the regulatoryauxiliary supply. The automatically activated isolated operationcrashed a few seconds after the failure of gas turbine 1 as a result ofoverloading. This caused the dependent auxiliary energies (compressedair, nitrogen, cooling water) to break down. The plant's third networkwas not affected.The power supply was restored after approx. 10 minutes and the procedure was completed another 15 minutes later.The emergency shut-down of the plants obliged to activate the flaresystems producing noise and soot plumes, although this did not have anyother external harmful effects on the environment.When the installations started up again, there were unpleasantammonia/armine odours for a short period of time in the vicinity. 16people sought outpatient treatment as a result.

Damage amounting to approx. 1,000,000 # and one member of staff killed.On 04. 01. 2005 during the morning it was foreseen to raise the ammonia level in the ammonia storage tank to a perceivable leve,l by pumping cold ammonia through a drain pipe. As preparation of this operation the injection of cold ammonia on the tank head was interrupted and a refrigerant compressor was started.In the context of this operation at 11:05 h the tank drainage valve, used as intake, was completely opened while the valve on the other end of the drain pipe was opened to \u00bc. During this operation a worker was staying on a platform at 3 m height, whereas another worker was standing below the platform. Both workers were permanently in contact over radio with the control room.Both workers heard an unusual noise after opening the valve of the drainage pipe. The worker on the platform closed the drain valve of the tank a few seconds after and left the platform over an access ladder. The control room operator noticed approximately at the same time a rapid pressure increase in the tank. In that moment (11:10) a loud bang occurred with the sudden release of ammonia gas which dispersed around against the wind. One worker could escape across to the wind. At some 30 m away he noticed the absence of his colleague. He immediately went towards the leak-point, finding his colleague lying on the ground injured and evidently unable to escape by himself. Nevertheless he was able to drag the victim out of the direct danger area. The victim suffered direct injuries and serious damage to the respiratory tractAnd skin burns due to ammonia.At 11:11 h another collaborator who noticed clearly the bang and ammonia release alerted the fire brigade. The fire brigade arrived at 11:23 h. At 11:37 first aid medical treatment was started.When the first ammonia release ended a leak appeared near the drain outlet at the bottom of the tank, more than 10m3/h of ammonia water were released an formed a pool in the retention pond.Ammonia evaporated from the pool and formed a visible mist which spread around at a speed of 7 m/s.During the following 4 to 6 hours two other leaks formed on the tank, located respectively approx. 90  to the drain outlet. At approx. 15:00 the fire brigade installed basins to catch leaking ammonia water, a vacuum pumping vehicle transferred the ammonia water into a storage tank which had been prepared meanwhile. From 17:00 h on the release rate reduced constantly, such that it was possible from 20:00 on to start pumping the pool of ammonia water from the retention pond. At about 22:00 the leak rate in the first leak was reduced at an almost not perceivable level, ammonia was still leaking only from the later formed leak points.At about 13:00 h the day after, approx 26 hours later, there were only minimal amounts of ammonia released from the three leak points. The last rests of ammonia water from the retention pool pond and from the drain pits was continued until 06.01.2005. False False False False",

One member of staff killed.An ignition of explosive residues was triggered by the heat and/or friction caused by cutting operations, the explosion caused the destruction of the pipe being cut and the rupture and fragmentation of a cutting disk.Description of the event:It was foreseen to install a new water pipe for a refrigeration plant in a machine room. The work was performed in the machine shop, where at time of the occurrence a worker was present.At 11:28 h a loud bang occurred, which was heard by a collaborator (having his office in the same building in which the explosion occurred. The collaborator left his office and noticed a broken window in the machine shop. Opening the door of the machine shop he noticed thick dust which progressively deposited on the ground. Further he noticed a strong hiss caused by air released from a damaged pressure pipe. The collaborator alerted directly the onsite emergency response services and the management of the company.The collaborator in the machine shop was found lying with his back on the ground and the feet towards the working bench, he presented injuries in correspondence to the head, the inguinal area and the left arm. A pipe on which cutting work had been performed was found between his legs. The pipe in question was a 80 cm DN-40 pipe, with flanges at both ends and a short DN-15 branch pipe. The pipe presents serious damages whereas the DN-15 pipe was completely ripped off.The immediately alerted emergency response service could only establish the death f the collaborator. The death had been caused by a splinter which had entered in the head of the collaborator. A exiting wound was found on the skull of the collaborator.A report on the cause of the accident suggests that abrasive cutting work was being performed on a pipe which was contaminated with the explosive nitropenta. It is suspected that a pipe from the processing plant was used contrary to instructions. This pipe had not been disposed of on the fire and detonation site as stipulated. The member of staff had been instructed accordingly six months beforehand. False False False False",

This is due to hydrogen which was still in the extraction ducts after the plant had been shut down.",

It was planned to substitute the gas pressure pipe being part of the reactor ethylene effective pressure measurement system. During shut down the operations of the plant the polymer in the high pressure separator (operative temperature 250  C) is washed out of the container with cold ethylene (ca. 100  C).12 kg of ethylene were released in the atmosphere due to a leakage in the flange coupling between the the high pressure separator and the low pressure separator. The released ethylene burned until the explosion occurred. As consequence of the fire the emergency relief valves of the reactors and the emergency relief valve of the wax separating pipe were triggered. The released ethylene ignited such that approximately 6 - 10 kg ethylene were burned. The rapid pressure release of the reactor caused secondary damage - the core barrel fissured and longitudinal fissure occurred in the external layer of the multiple layer container.

Steam was admitted to the toaster and to the jackets of hexane/miscella inlet pipes to heat-up the toasters and the extractor to the proper operating temperatures. At about 21:45 the toasters reached their operating temperature and admittance of flakes commenced through the inlet screw conveyor. After that, the following events occurred (the time shown had been approximately evaluated on instrument readings and information from the staff, as no log was in operation) until the explosion took place at 00:47:- 22:45 to 23:00: The night shift took over and at the same time the first flakes dropped from the outlet screw conveyor into the toasters.- 23:15: The toaster temperature dropped to 85 C. The plant operator therefore opened fully for the steam flow to the toaster jackets and the upper parts (direct steam) of the toasters. About the same time the safety flap valve was heard lifting releasing hexane and steam into the extractor building, where the smell of hexane was detected by the operators. This was, however, not an abnormal occurrence during the start-up.- 23:25: One of the flake outlet conveyors stopped due to overloading and the interlocking system stopped the flake inlet conveyor and the internal belt conveyor but not the other outlet conveyor nor the steam and hexane flows. High hexane concentrations were detected in the extractor building. The plant operator, however, was of the opinion that the steam and hexane flows were stopped according to the operation procedure.- 23:35: The flake outlet conveyor was restarted and the operating staff began to search for the hexane release point but without success. The hexane concentration in the extraction building finally reached a level which forced the staff out of the extractor building.- 23:55: A bus driver passing the facility detected the hexane vapours and about the same time the sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the released hot hexane/steam mixture.- 00:15: The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (CPO). At the same time they stopped the above mentioned bus driver, when he was to pass again warning him against the possible danger. The bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade.- 00:25: The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance.- 00:35: The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty arrived. The CPO went into the extractor building and located the leak to the safety flap, from which gas/liquids clearly appeared.- 00:40-00:45: The CPO and the Fire Inspector discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to do this by cutting off the power supply. They called the power plant engineer and asked him to do it. Due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer at about 00:47.- 00:47.30: A fire seen in the far end of the extractor yard was spotted followed by a strong explosion injuring 27 persons (staff members, firemen and police officers) and damaging completely 6 buildings.

Based on the investigations carried out, it has been concluded that excessive amounts of steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor led to lifting and relocating of the safety flap valve. The steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor occurred due to lack of flakes in the outlet screw conveyors, which acted as a barrier against steam/gas flow. As a consequence, hexane was released and led to an explosion. Based on the available information it seems clear that the explosion was initiated by the disconnection of a transformer which ignited the hexane cloud.CAUSESThe leakage of hexane (flammable/explosive gas) was due to the incorrect operation of the safety flap valve caused by the failure of the interlocking system to cut-off the steam and hexane flows to the toaster when one of the extractor outlet conveyors was stopped. An unloaded transformer, disconnected by mistake just before the explosion, is believed to have caused the ignition of the hexane vapours cloud.",

The police responded together with the Fire Brigade. The area around the establishment was sealed off and a warning to the public was given through the National Broadcasting System. The Fire Brigade located the chlorine release, stopped the hot water spray system and finally stopped the leakage about 2 hours after the police was called, by refitting the bushing and the valve stem at 19:35.

Similar equipment was already in use for the same production but the new reactor was microprocessor controlled, especially for controlling the chlorine addition rate and the cooling in order to maintain the process conditions (30 C and atmospheric pressure) because the chlorination of 0,0-Dimethyl-phosphorodithiotic acid (MP-1) to MP-2 is exothermic.The reaction took place in extraction naphtha (E-60). By-products were thioperoxy-diphosphoric acid tetramethyl ester (MP-11), hydrogen chloride and sulphur.During commissioning, the temperature controller was blocked while testing the microprocessor and the connection was not re-established before starting operation. The production started at noon and the operators did not paid attention to the temperature that was recorded. Owing to a high chlorine addition rate and no cooling, the temperature rose to be in excess of 120 C about 2 hours after the production started. The solvent (naphta) evaporated and a sudden fast decomposition occurred at 17:55. This resulted in fracture of the rupture disc, in deformation of the reactor lid and in elongation of the bolts of the lid. Flammable gasses were released through the venting system and through the opened reactor lid into process hall. The vapour cloud was ignited when it reached the control room causing an explosion. On the basis of the deformations of the reactor and of the building, Cheminova Agro estimated that the pressure in the reactor reached values of 25-35 bar and that the overpressure in the building reached values of 100-150 mbar. The fire was extinguished by the internal fire brigade assisted by the local fire brigade.

The solvent E-60 evaporated and, when the temperature reached the decomposition value for MP-1, MP-2 and MP-11, a sudden fast decomposition occurred, resulting in deformation, opening of the reactor and then release of flammable gases inside the building and control room. The gases were then ignited and an explosion occurred. CAUSES:Prior to start the production, the temperature sensor was blocked while testing the microprocessor. The connection was not re-established when the computer was used for process control in the production of MP-2. Process temperature was not otherwise supervised by the operators, although the temperature automatically was recorded. Due to the lack of temperature control, a sudden fast decomposition of MP-1, MP-2 and MP-11 occurred, resulting in deformation, opening of the reactor and then release of flammable gases inside the process building and control room. The reactor was equipped with a venting system and a relief pipe provided with a rupture disc but the relief capacity of the system was however insufficient compared to the amount of gases released during the fast decomposition of the substances. The gases were ignited and an explosion occurred. The electrical installations in the control room may have been the source of ignition.

The solid residue flowed out of the building.CAUSES:The likely cause was storage mistakes, which caused chemical reactions between the stored chemicals. These reactions were exothermic and initiated the fast decomposition of FAS. The exothermic reactions took probably place between the bags of FAS and the bags of alkaline soap. Alkaline dust from sodium carbonate, which was sprinkled on the floor to give a driving support for trucks, may also have been involved in the reaction, and condensed water may have been accelerated the reactions. The storage of FAS in two layers may have accelerated the rate of decomposition, as it reduced the heat transfer from the bags. organized procedures training/instruction unexpected reaction/phase-transition operator error",

The largest one had a diameter of 5.4 m and was 1.5 m deep. The power of the explosion, according to calculations, corresponds to 1770 kg TNT (tolite). The explosion blasted the metallic structure of the building and the blasting effect severely damaged two other storage buildings deforming the structure of one. These storage buildings were hit by incandescent metallic projectiles. Due to the damaging of the external panelling, fires ignited. Cases containing gunpowder exploded in one of the storage buildings. The second one burned with sporadic explosions flares. The combustion of smoke candles and similar products created a dense black smoke.The 142 employees of the plant were put in technological unemployment."

The product recently produced got in touch with the exposed, one year older lot.

The off-site emergency plan was released and the potentially affected population sheltered-in-place. It was agreed with the operator to classify the accident at level 3 of the accident gravity scale (noxious effects offsite the plant premises).Precipitation: NoneTemp.: 26Wind speed: 6.5 m/sDirection: 139 Meteorological conditions: wind speed from 20:00 h to 21:00 h 6.5 m/sec direction 139 ; from 21:00 h to 22:00 h 6.5 m/sec 4 m/s, direction 132 ; from 22:00 h to 23:00 h 1.5 m/sec 4 m/s, direction 37 , temperature changing from 26 C to 29 CBetween 20:00 hrs and 20:15 hrs on 17th July 4 workers were present in the plant, including the shift supervisor, when one of the workers detected smoke originating from the transit area where 37 tons of product were stored. The worker reached the area with a portable extinguisher and gas mask and found two rows of 1ton bags containing anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate on the extreme left of the area and placed at a distance of 50 cm from each other. He could distinguish two piles of big bags in the front and another two big bags on the ground a bit more to the right. He declared that he could see smoke rising from the wooden pallet placed under the bag pile and the bottom bag on the right. He emptied the portable extinguisher, found another two and emptied them too but could not stop the combustion process and smoke development.The product leaking from the big bag at the bottom of the pile caused the two bags above to crash on the ground, feeding the combustion process, developing flames and intensive smoke.Meanwhile two other workers who had been alerted by the main alarm siren of the chlorine detectors reached the area shortly after the first worker and the shift supervisor sent them to the chlorine storage area. They connected an extinguishing hose to the manifold of two pumps feeding from two 10m3 water tanks, which were used for operations under normal conditions. The tanks are located approximately 20 metres from the area affected by the fire. Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area. At 20:58 hrs, after extinguishing operations had been started, the chief officer of the fire brigade informed the Control Room that a chlorine cloud was forming.At 21:05 hrs the officer requested activation of the off-site emergency response plan.At 21:11 hrs the off-site emergency plan was activated, the municipalities located downwind and potentially affected by the cloud were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The first fire fighters reaching the site found one extinguishing system of the company out of order due to a missing pressure device.At 21:49 hrs the fire was extinguished and the control room was notified.At 22:15 hrs the on-site emergency plan was called off andAt 23:00 hrs the off-site emergency plan was called off.

It is assumed that part of the product reached the drainage channel and ignited on coming into contact with grease, oils, water and other organic residues.Full report remarks:The operator supposes that most probably the anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate, spilled during the morning from a big bag on the ground, reached the drainage channel, starting a decomposition reaction in contact with water; this formed a white cloud and ignited the fire.According to the accident dynamics and to the interviews with the personnel a deliberate action appears not to be probable. maintenance/repair vessel/container/containment-equipment failure transport accident",

Initially the smoke cloud was moving towards the two nearest municipalities, later the wind direction changed. For this reason the municipalities lying nearby, which could have been potentially affected by the cloud, were informed about the occurrence and were requested to alert the population to immediately take shelter.The municipalities alerted are the ones mentioned above.Sheltering of the population living nearest to the installation was carried out by the following municipalities: - Les Franqueses de Vall\u00e8s (communities of Llerona and Corro del Val)- L'Amettla del Vall\u00e8s- Sta Eu\u00e0lia de Ron\u00e7ana- Conovelles- Llica d'AmuntWe estimate the total population sheltering to be approximately 20,000 inhabitants.Together with the first fire warnings the emergency response services also received complaints from persons living in the neighbourhood of the plant concerning irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.Ecological Harm-remarks:There were no consequences caused by the toxic effects of the cloud in the immediate vicinity of the plant because chlorine and other decomposition products forming the cloud were at high temperatures; consequences were reported only in areas at a distance of more than one kilometre, when the smoke cooled down and deposited.Material loss:The company had already scheduled to close down the plant approximately one month after the accident occurred. Another plant substituting the old one was already operative.The social cost of the accident has not been evaluated."

The vacuum diesel is preheated and enters the reactor where a fluidized bed catalyst carries out the molecule cracking reactions. The gases that leave the reactor enter the primary fractionation stage where they separate into three lateral streams: - Heavy petrol that will be used to make up petrols and diesel oils. - Light oil that is used in the composition of commercial diesel. - Heavy oil that has similar applications to light oil. Products obtained from overhead fractionation are more volatile; slurry, obtained from the bottom, is a heavy stream that is sent to fuel oil. The gases are sent to the Lights section and the following products are obtained: - Light petrol which is used in the composition of commercial petrols. - Medium-light petrol. - Medium-heavy petrol. - Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). - Acid gas The purpose of the lights section is to separate incondensable gases, LPG and light petrol. In the de-ethanizing absorber (C-41) incondensable gases are separated overhead. In the debutanizer (C-43) LPG is separated overhead and light petrol is obtained from the bottom. In both columns, separation is carried out using heat, and by setting the pressure and temperatures at the head and bottom of both columns to the appropriate values to obtain the separations. In the debutanizer, gases are obtained from the head and the bottom, and without these gases light petrol is produced.

The debutanizing column (C-43) should have extracted these gases, which are commonly found in the gas stream in order for them to undergo treatment. Due to insufficient temperature and pressure in this unit, extraction did not occur. The gases accumulated in the petrol tank (2178 C) forming a pocket that spread outside the recipient until an ignition source set off a gas blast. The explosion occured at 8:15 am and displaced the tank's floating roof (2178 C) and began the combustion of the gasoline contained within it (2 400 m3). The fire spread to the other gasoline tanks housed in the same area (C 2) as well as to the outer lying installations.

Inadequate everyday work procedures in the FCC unit. High levels of gas stored in the tanker, which led to the displacement of the tanker's floating roof.

The result was the explosion of the centrifugal pump and death of an operator.It can be indicated, as causes for the explosion the lack of efficient inertization of the centrifugal pump, lack of risk analysis and lack of operating procedures, along with an efficient system for risk control and inspection. According to the data available, the inspector reporting states that, had the establishment had documentation conforming and implementing RD 1254/1999, it would have been very unlikely that the accident would have taken place, so it cannot be excluded as a cause for the accident the failure of the establishment to comply with the law.Apart from material causes for the accident, other organisational causes must be studied. In this sense, it is reflected that:a) There had been no hazard analyses from the establishment regarding the centrifugal pumps working with solvents, required for this type of installations.b) There was not a clear working procedure specifying the hazards related to the activity.c) The operator did not have a specific preparation for the task, and his instructions were communicated to him by a person in charge.d) The inspection and / or internal control system took care of basic aspects of safety at work prevention but did not consider any element related to the risk of an explosion.

Flammable gases and liquids were released in the explosion and set the reactor building on fire. The rise of temperature of the chemical liquid in the reactor was caused by a deposit in the reactor base as well as heat formed by mechanical friction of the reactor stirred.

An inflammable atmosphere had thus been created in the pipe section adjacent to the boilers. On the day of the accident, this atmosphere caused an explosion in the air inlet to one of the boilers; this blast spread to the duct section near the fan.

However, the most likely course of events was judged to be the following: 1. After the start-up the hydraulic equipment commenced functioning normally, according to the control system. 2. Due to the failure of the gasket of the lifting cylinder, the heavy piston was able to move fairly freely3. The air pressure in the pressing cylinder increased to several bars causing a rise of the temperature higher than self ignition temperature of the propellant. Because of the fast lowering of the piston the suction pump was not able to develop a vacuum quickly enough. 4. As a result of the fast rising temperature in the pressing cylinder the propellant probably self-ignited. 5. After the pressure had reached high enough (to the range above 5 kbars) the burning of the propellant transformed into a detonation. 6. The piston lifted very quickly due to the high pressure of the explosion and then returned downwards again at a very high speed caused by the gas pressure. At this point the seal of the lifting cylinder was totally destroyed. The lower part of the lifting cylinder expanded. component/machinery failure/malfunction",

A main valve of oxygen gas pipeline broke at Avesta Polarit's Tornio melt shop line number 2 on the 19th of September. The accident caused an explosive fire, which was extinguished within half an hour. The accident took the lives of three peoples. No-one was injured. The melt shop was in an annual maintenance shutdown and control work was being done on valves on the oxygen distribution pipeline. Main pipeline runs from the exterior of the building to the melt shop. The back-pressure valves had been changed and the testing of the system was starting up. The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. Accident Case HistoryA fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing thestart-up of the oxygen systems.The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9  turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire. False False False True gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air conflagration (a general engulfment fire)",
        "causes_description": "causes:  On the basis of the investigation the fire may have ignited in three different ways:1) The slide bearings of the valve disc stem may have been damaged, and two steel surfaces may have come into contact in the damaged area. When the valve was being opened, these two surfaces may have become hot by the friction and set fire to the plastic bearing material which ignites more easily than steel.2) The valve may have been opened without equalising the pressure. In this case the dust particles from pipeline in the fast oxygen flow of the valve gap would have struck valve parts, become hot, and ignited the valve to burn in the oxygen. 3) A foreign object may have got stuck in the valve and formed a friction pair that caused friction heating when the valve was being opened. The third option is possible even though the by-pass line had been used, but the first two necessitate the opening of the valve without equalising the pressure. isolation of equipment/system other other Yes",

One of the fatalities was the foreman of the factory, one the foreman of the subcontractor and third fatality was a subcontractors welder, who had come to the scene just before the accident. They were killed immediately.The fire was extinguished relatively quickly as the flow of oxygen was closed down and the fire brigade commenced fire-fighting activities. The success of fire damage limitation was due to fire containment compartments and non-flammable roof structures. Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment"

The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first explosion could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic wave was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building.An inquiry commission was rapidly formed after the accident and worked in close contact with and under the supervision of administrative and judicial authorities.

The examination of material in the foundry shop near the presumed starting point of the explosion showed that the motor of a mobile hoist located 15 metres from the supposed point of explosion presented indisputable traces of the passage of lightning-related current. In addition, it was possible to determine numerous possibilities for the routing of the current leading to the starting point of the explosion. In particular, the casting pit itself, where the explosion started, was the best grounding point in proximity to the motor. It was supposed that the molten aluminium alloy could have led to: either an explosion of aluminium alloy droplets dispersed in air (which involves a suspension process) or a reaction of molten aluminium with water. The first was opted for. The molten aluminium was suspended in air by the action of the shock wave produced by the electric arc. The shock wave dispersed 150-300 kg (of a total of 1,200 kg) of molten aluminium alloy around the casting frame in the form of a fog of fine droplets. Only a part of the energy of the shock wave was used in this dispersion process. The fog then exploded (as a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT) as a result of the droplets/air reaction. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two seconds later, as a result of the rapid vaporization of cooling water in contact with the molten metal, which fell from the upper part of the casting pit.

The works consisted in cleaning the pipes internal (the presence of small holes was also suspected). The foam pipe had been already cut and, when a worker attempted to light a torch by a briquet, an explosion occurred. The subsequent fire was quickly extinguished by application of suitable foam already available in the establishment. The activities relevant to this maintenance works can be summarized as follows: - 16/12/88: Operations department requested the verification of the fire fighting system. The maintenance department took over the activities and called an external contractor. The extent of works was normally defined by maintenance department without the intervention of operation department. The aim was to repair the network by installing flanges and perform a hydraulic pressure test. Hence the presence of small holes on the fire water pipes can be suspected. These works had to be performed over an empty tank and piping.- 25/01/89: Initiation of maintenance works.- 26/01/89: Interruption of maintenance works according to the instructions of the maintenance department because more urgent works had to be executed in another part of the plant.- 30/01/89: Production department put the storage tank again in operation by filling it up with benzene, believing that maintenance works had been completed.- 02/02/89: Maintenance department ordered maintenance works to be resumed since they had not been informed by the production department that the storage tank had been put in service. The work permit had been also erroneously co-signed by the production department. When a worker lighted the torch a fire started at the open foam pipe and through this was transmitted to the storage tank which exploded.

This may have had a possible relation with the explosion.ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:No wind when the fire occurred.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During modification works on non-energized electrical cables, at 13:05 a flash fire in the pumping station occurred followed after 1 minute by an explosion in the area. Ten minutes later, at 13:15 the first tank (250 m3 storage capacity for additives) exploded, and fired like a rocket up to about 200m, falling down 60 m away outside the storage area and spreading the fire to about 1/3 of the depot. The explosion of 5 other tanks followed. At 13:18 the local authorities were alarmed by telephone and, at 13:23, a first control center was made up by the fire brigade. At 13:28 the fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation; at the same time arrived the first medical service (3 doctors with an ambulance). At 13:40 the traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. On-site there were 8 doctors, 5 ambulances and 2 re-animation vehicles. 18 beds for injured people were available. At 13:55, 117 policemen were present (200 at 14:20). At 14:10 the cooling of tanks (about 2,000m3/h by means of 25 monitors) was activated (it was carried out until the fire was extinguished). At 14:30, 200 policemen, 150 firemen, 20 doctors and nurses were present on-site. At 14:45, the Particular Emergency Plan was activated and the organization of emergency was under the direct control of the local Prefect. At 17:00 the fire spread all over the depot despite the water cooling. At 17:25 a first attempt to extinguishing the fire was carried out by means of 9 guns using 100,000 litres of foam. At 18:32 the explosion of another tank occurred and 6 firemen were wounded. The fire extended. The medical staff was reinforced. The explosion was due to boil-over of a tank containing 1,000 m3 of gasoil which created a fire-ball nearly 450m high and 200m wide. The fire spread to to the neighbouring storage area and to various buildings inside the installation. At that time, about 72,000 litres of foam were used. During the night 2 floating roof tanks in the near storage area caught fire. At 06:35 of June 3rd, a second attempt to extinguish the fire was carried out by means of 17 guns (2 of which with a large flow) using 200,000 litres of foam. The use of foam monitors with large capacity (6,000 litres/min) had proved really efficient. At 07:30 the fire in the storage area was extinguished. At 09:00 the fire was extinguished using 140,000 litres of foam during the second attempt (there was still a small leak at the bottom of a tank). At 13:48 the fire was completely extinguished. The cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days (4 and 5), using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure. On June 6th-7th, a small quantity of foam was used, as a preventive measure, during the draining of some tanks. Polluted fire fighting water and unburned hydrocarbons that could be contained (about 10,000 m3 remained in the parks and drains) were collected and transferred by barges and wagons to a petroleum refinery for treatment.

Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150firemen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed tocontrol the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial areaand transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them weredoctors) give medical help.MATERIAL LOSS:More than ten tanks in the storage area No 1 and 3 were completely destroyed (tanks No 6, 12, 14, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 59.1, 20 and 22) or damaged in such a way to make impossible their use. Also, the loading stations, the office building, some vehicles parked nearby and other components in the storage installation were destroyed. No data are available about the cost of the material damages.ECOLOGICAL HARM:During the fire were released into the environment sulphur dioxide, lead compounds and particulate produced by the combustion of hydrocarbons. The amount of sulphur dioxide and lead compounds had been estimated, respectively, in 12 tonnes and 600 kg. No data are available about the amount of particulate released. In the document attached to the Original Report the observed environmental pollution was not significant. When that document was prepared, the risk of pollution of underground waters due to the infiltration of hydrocarbons in the soil was not yet completely resolved and the control of the water bearing stratum had to carry out.MAP OF THE ACCIDENT AREA AND MAX.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:At 08:00 four people started to work in the storage installation and, at 08:30, everything was normal. Some smoke was noticed by the storage personnel at about 09:15 am. The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened even if visible fire was never noticed. At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. Fire fighting operations proceeded with difficulty owing to the jellow/red smoke cloud which had developped. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the compartment involved in the fire by means of water curtains. At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started (shelter information to the public by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations). At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (the concentrations of main pollutants [nitric acid, nitrogen oxides and ammonia] inside and outside the storehouse and at nearby communities as a function of time are available in the Original Report and the in relevant presentation in the Seminar on The Notification of Major Accidents held at Rethymnon Greece on October 6/7 in 1988). The toxic cloud reached an height of about 250m and was 5km large and it was covering a surface of about 15 km. At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators. At 14:15 the ORSEC plan was activated and at 14:30 the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00 while reinforcement from other departments continued to arrive. At 17:20 the Prefect gave a Press Conference and at 18:00 a survey on the percentage evacuation achieved was undertaken. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00. At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished.

        "causes_description": "causes:  CAUSES:When the Original Report was prepared the causes of the accident have not fully identified but it is supposed that it occurred as a combination of the following elements:a) storage of a fertilizer compound which decomposed (this phenomenon is called self-substaining decomposition) due to a too high temperature and an excessive concentration of organic material (wheat saw dust) due to previous transportation;b) no monitoring by means of thermometric probes of the development of high temperature in the heap during storage was foreseen;c) the presence in the fertilizers heap of defective (due to poor insulation) power cables. These defective cables (due to their age and the oversizing of the fuses and circuit breakers) caused the fertilizers decomposition; the short duration in which electrical current flew should be pointed out (switch-on at about 09:00 and detection of smoke and switch-off at about 09:15). On the other hand, the short-circuit assumption must be discarded because people worked until they were switched off and, besides, no blown fuse was found and the heat generated by a short-circuit is generally insufficient to initiate decomposition;d) wooden pallets in contact with the fertilizers compounds which caught fire during decomposition and released heat which accelerated the decomposition;e) the absence of any efficient fire-fighting means. If there had been a massive quantity of water rapidly available to put out the fire, the decomposition could have been slowed down before to develop out of control. Yes",

The contaminated fire fighting water caused a slight pollution of the La Loire river.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:When the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident, preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started, but, about 5 hours after the smoke began to appear, it was necessary to evacuate only 25,000 people. The rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. The ORSEC plan was activated and the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. Public was informed by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations.Discussion of consequences: At 15:30, the maximum concentrations measured inside the installation were: nitric acid = 50ppm; nitrogen oxides = 5 ppm; chlorine = 3ppm. At 22:00 there were: nitric acid = 15ppm; nitrogen oxides = 5 ppm; chlorine = less 0.3ppm. At 02:45 there were: nitric acid = 0ppm; nitrogen oxides = 1 ppm; chlorine = 0.2ppm. Outside the installation, at 15:30 there were: nitric acid = 5ppm; nitrogen oxides = 0.2 ppm. At 22:00 there were 5ppm of nitric acid. Ammonia was not detected, both inside and outside.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of : Ecological component: water catchment areas and supplies for consumption or recreation - Affected 3"

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A wrong mixing operation in a reactor in the production area Z9 could caused an explosion followed by a fire. More precisely, the addition of a new product to the silicon oil caused a release of hydrogen, and perhaps also sodium hydride, due to a wrong pH control (this reaction, when was experimentally performed in a laboratory, caused a deflagration). The worker who performed the defective operation was alone in the plant. Seriously burned, he had been found many tens of metres from the point where the explosion occurred; it is unknown however if he was displaced by the explosion or if he was transported there by other people or if he had escaped before the explosion. A call for help was received at 03:07 by the centre of alert transmission of Tours and it was re-trasmitted to the centres of Chateau-Renault and Amboise. At 03:20 a fire fighting vehicle from Chateau-Renault arrived on-site. Since the accident led to the rupture of three fire hydrants, two lances were installed taking water from the Brenne river, 500 metres away. At 03:40 the fire fighting vehicle from Amboise arrived and at 04:06 4 lances were in operation. Meanwhile, the fire covered a surface of about 2,000-3,000 m2. At 05:52 two foam guns arrived from Tours and, when at 06:15, 2 foam tankers arrived on-site, they were put in operation with positive effects due to the synthetic foam used. Owing to the formation of a toxic cloud inside the building, at about 05:00 the Mayor of Chateau-Renault decided to evacuate a building where 200 handicapped people were housed. From 05:00 to 08:30 analyses of the cloud composition have been performed every half an hour. Those analyses revealed the presence of hydrogen cyanide, carbon oxide, nitrogen oxides and halogens. At 08:30 the analysis revealed only some traces of carbon oxide. There was the risk of intoxication for the rescuers (because they had no suitable personnel protection equipment) and also a risk of explosion of nearby reactors and vessels. The water used to cool these vessels and to extinguish the fire (500-600m3/h) caused the pollution of the Brenne river crossing the site. A dike was built a few hours after the fire started to prevent discharge of used fire fighting water to this river. Despite these measures, phenols were found in Loire river fed by the Brenne river. The authorities decided to interrupt (for three days) the distribution of drinking water to 200,000 people. Drinking water needs were estimated to be 45,000m3/day and were covered by various sources (interconnection with water networks of nearby communities, the use of water sources not affected by the pollution, the use of deep wells, extended the use of bottled mineral water and the use of two trains of 3,000 m3 capacity each).

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During a weekly test programme, at 11:30 two maintenance operators started to test the isolation valves and the space piston pump. At about 11:50 this spare pump was switched-on and, immediately after, a leakage from a piping located above the operators occurred. They quickly escaped towards the control room before the gas was ignited by the pyrolysis furnace. The Internal Emergency Plan was activated. The unit was shut-down and fire protection means were activated while the affected area was evacuated. The fire was not extinguished to avoid formation of an explosive gas cloud; at the same time the protection of structures exposed to intense heat radiation using cooling via fixed monitors and of the pyrolysis furnace by means of a fixed water curtain was necessary. Isolation valves around the unit on fire were closed to reduce the amount of flammable substances potentially involved. However, one of the isolation valves could not be completely closed (because the accident occurred during a test) and therefore the duration of the fire was prolonged. After 10 minutes other pipes were ruptured causing an escalation of the fire, which was finally extinguished after 13 hours (at about 00:45). Damages to the plant were confined to an area of 20-25m radius on a platform at an elevation of 6m. A nearby school was evacuated when a hydrogen chloride concentration of 10-15ppm was measured in the vicinity. Hydrogen chloride concentrations measured indicate that confinment should have been preferred versus the evacuation. Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases. Used fire fighting water was collected for treatment at the waste-water treatment facilities of the plant.

Besides, further studies confirmed that the installation of a diaphragm with an opening smaller than originally planned (in order to obtain a more accurate measure of the liquid flow) aggravated the erosion (the diameter reduction of the diaphragm from 192mm to 132mm caused an increase of the liquid speed of a factor of 2.1 and of the turbulence effects of a factor of 4.5). In effects, the piping, in a zone downstream 10-60cm the diaphragm, showed a higher erosion than in the other section and therefore, when the spare pump was switched-on, the liquid flow was sufficient to rupture the pipe. process analysis design of plant/equipment/system corrosion/fatigue",

Immediately, he alerted the personnel in the proximity of the leakage to abandon the site and called in the company fire brigade, that intervened immediately after. Not withstanding the alert, a vehicle of an external company passed through the gas cloud, and its motor stopped due to the high concentration of ethylene in air. The driver, trying to put again in operation his vehicle, created a spark which ignited the flammable gas cloud resulting in an explosion that caused the rupture of the transethylene pipeline and its deplacement. This originated a jet-fire, fed by the ethylene escaping through the ruptured pipeline, directed towards a warehouse containing tens of barrels of liquid hydrocarbons (ethyl acetate and dimethylcycloctadiene) and sacks of thermoplastic caoutchouc (rubber). A fire started in the warehouse. The shock wave produced by the explosion caused also the displacement of a second ethylene pipeline (diameter 6, operating at a pressure of 90 bar) located under the 10 pipe on the piperack. The displacement caused its fall and rupture, resulting in a second unconfined vapour cloud explosion. The company fire brigade was assisted by the fire brigades of nearby companies and the local fire brigade in extinguishing the fire. 4 fire fighting vehicles were damaged by the explosion of the gas cloud but, after about 2 hours, 2 of them were already operating. 2.5 hours later a third one was operating too.

The underground pipes were feeding eleven tanks in different conditions (empty but not degassified, half empty, full, empty and degassified, empty). Maintenance work started on June 11 (hot work-permit had been ordinarily issued on June 10 and the pipes were empty). When the fire started, the water emulsion in the tank basins became yellow and ignited resulting in fire. The alarm was sounded and all valves were automatically closed (it required about 14 minutes). Soon after, the power supply was also interrupted. After inspection, all accessible valves were found to be closed and therefore rapid extinguishing of the fire was to be expected. Instead, the phenomenon repeated various times that afternoon and the flames were extinguished by the personnel quickly. There was an unsuccessful attempt to extinguish the fire by covering the inspection pit with sand. The fire escalated but the personnel in collaboration with the fire brigade managed to confine it within the tank dike by applying foam using foam monitors. At about 15:20 an explosion occurred and, even if all people thought it was tank No 76, the explosion was caused by two acetylene bottles used in the maintenance works. Finally, it was found that a valve of tank No 1 (full of gasoline) had been opened (for reasons not clarified) and it was releasing gasoline with a rate of 150 m3/h. The fire was extinguished at 15:40 (about 4.5 hours after it started).

The simplified process scheme is described in immediate sources of accident. It may be useful to point out that the bottom of the column is enclosed by a heating chamber containing the gas burners and the exhaust gas heat exchanger. At that level, releases of zinc oxides (C.A.S. No: 1314-13-2) which had to be absorbed occurred regularly. ",
        "location_description": "units:  The accident occurred in a blast-furnace installation of a zinc andlead production plant and more precisely in the fractional distillationunit, which receives the liquid zinc directly from the blast furnace.The fractional distillation unit comprises 10 sequential distillationcolumns allowing lead to be separated from other heavy metals andcadmium to vaporise. The columns had been constructed in 1967 and werelocated side by side under a building.The accident occurred on a 13m high cadmium distillation column.",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  The accident involved a cadmium distillation column. The column wasformed by a stack of 59 silicon carbide trays heated to 1000 C. Theheating chamber enclosing the bottom of the distillation column waskept depressurised.The temperature was monitored at different points of the distillationunit, and the temperature control was assured by regulating manuallyboth the gas flow to the burners and the draught. The essentialmaintenance task was to absorb zinc oxides releases which occurredrelatively frequently between the trays, fouling the installation. Thecleaning operation was performed through inspection openings on thewalls of the heating chamber, which were closed during operation withrefractory plugs and sealed with clay. This operation was performed byrefractory bricklayers employed by the company or by a specialisedsubcontractor.Independently, the columns were operated permanently during 18 months.Any shut-down or significant drop in temperature would have caused therupture of the trays, particularly sensitive to thermal shocks.The accident scenario was as follows:- 27/05/1993: 7 weeks before the event, start-up of the column in whichthe accident originated after refurbishment (new tray stack, new flues)- 24/06/93: start of the effective production phase- 24/06/93: 17:00 h an abnormal rumbling noise which had never beenheard before in a refurbished installation, alerted the operators. Aninspection showed a temperature rise in the heat exchanger and asignificant fouling.- 25/06/93: during the morning before the event, several operationswere carried out without success to re-establish normal operatingconditions.- 25/06/93: at 12:10 h a sudden divergence of the lateral temperatures was observed in the heating chamber.- 25/06/93: at 12:25 h 11persons (production manager, workshop manager,experienced employees, temporary personnel, refractory bricklayers froma subcontractor) were located near the column when the accidentoccurred. False False False False",
        "causes_description": "causes:  Different assumptions can be made concerning the causes of the accident:1. - The fouling of the combustion chamber caused by considerable zinc oxides releases, lead to an incomplete combustion process and the formation of non-combusted gas pockets, which exploded when fresh air was supplied by the opening of inspection openings or of the flues.2. - The oxygen impoverishment of the oven permitted a direct reaction of the zinc released by the leaking column and the carbon dioxide present. This reaction is very exothermic.3. - The simultaneous opening of several inspection openings extinguished the burners causing a collapse of several trays and an uncontrolled vaporisation of the zinc.

A muffled explosion noise was perceived by the personnel in the control room some dozen metres from the column. A burning gas cloud was emitted by the column, forming a white fog which diffused in a few minutes in the whole workshop.Human losses were very high: the 11 persons present were seriously burned, 10 died in the following minutes, hours or days, the only survivor suffered 90% burns."

False False False False",
        "causes_description": "causes:  The synthesis operation had already been performed several times over 2 years.A material balance has demonstrated that the flow of imide compound transferred in the reactor was 8 to 9 times higher than foreseen. The operators could control this flow by regulating the number of pulsations of the dosing pump by means of a regulating screw and by acting on two manual valves located upstream of the pump. After the accident, the dosing pump was found to be regulated for a high flow and the two upstream manual valves were completely open.The reduction of an imide compound by sodium tetrahyddroborate in an ether type solvent medium is a hazardous reaction. Sodium tetrahyddroborate and Aluminium trichloride can decompose in presence of water, even if in trace quantities, forming eventually hydrochloric acid or hydrogen.When the accident occurred significant quantities of hydrogen were formed by the runaway reaction and were not absorbed by the reaction medium. The ignition of the gas may have been caused by static electricity in the reactor, a hot spot or the presence of diborane and water traces.The process instructions did not consider the flow regulations to be performed during transfer operations. These flow regulations were left to the know-how of the operators.The workers who were working at the reactor when the accident occurred were experienced with the exception of the worker who performed the imide compound transfer for the first time.The unit worked discontinuosly and was essentially operated manually. Considering the hazards releated to the reaction, the equipment has to be absolutely reliable and there has to be enough personnel to control the functioning of the equipment in completely safe conditions. These conditions were not guaranteed the day of the accident because:- 2 pumps with different flow capacity could be used for transfer operation, but no flow control meter was provided.- there were no safety or devices to alert the operators in case of a drift of the operating parameters (high flow, high pressure in the reactor,)- the unit was not equipped with remote control valves allowing the reactors to be isolated rapidly. The reactors could not be discharged rapidly, a neutralisation of the reacting medium was impossible.- the installation was brittle due to glass components.",

The tank was scheduled for repair works after the detection of an incipient crack on a weld. 2 days before the accident, the tank had been emptied and isolated. A 400 mm diameter manhole was left half open. A connecting piping between the tank roof and an adsorption column captured the hydrochloric acid vapours. A more or less dense sludge, with an average thickness of 60 mm, was deposited on the bottom of the tank. The sludge contained corrosion products, sulphur chloride and a variety of other impurities.

The mixed boiler was available for starting up with gas, and the previous team did various vain attempts to start. The message has been transmitted to the night team that try the same to put the boiler in service. An instruction is given by the quarter chief to go and examine the position of the obturator ONIS which allows to block up the main gas circuit.A few before the explosion, an untimely release of gas arrives in the underground, joined probably to the erroneous action of the ONIS obturator by one of the operators. The noise warns the quarter chief, who send another operator in order to locally intervene. The in-service gas boiler is shut down with urgency, and the personnel go out to cut the general supply at the level of the cut off place, 110 m away from the building. At this time the explosion occurs. Warned by the noise, the firemen arrive on place very rapidly, some minutes or more after the explosion. The red plan (help to the victims in large number) is immediately unlatched. 50 vehicles and 200 firemen, arrived from 12 fire-stations, are engaged in the fight and in the rescue. The different ignited fires on site are extinguished without particular difficulty. Various hundreds of C.R.S. men (compagnie republicaine de surete') participate to the fight against the spillage.The extremely rapid guarding (less than 1/2 hour after the explosion) of the businesses which have lost their shop-windows permits to avoid the essential from the thefts.The measurements made by universitary sismographs shows that the dissipated energy on the ground is equivalent to a load of 50 kg of TNT.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Without anticipating the conclusions of the on course judicial inquiry, the available information show that the explosion is probably linked to a gas escape occurred of the feed line of the boilers in the under ground of the plant, at the level of an operculum obturator ONIS installed on the line which supplies the only mixed boiler. This obturator found unlocked and partially open, should have been wrongly operated.The carbon boiler on duty at the moment of the event could not be urgently shut down.It constitutes one of the hot points more susceptible to have generated the explosion.Considered the importance of the network pressure and of leak section represented by this partial opening, it is possible that the power of the gas jet has been sufficient to create a suspension of carbon powder, that could have had two consequences:- the opacity of the local atmosphere could have prevented the operator to successfully intervene on the manual valve close to the leakage point;- the accident could have been created by an explosive mixture of gas and carbon powder gas, the behaviour of this last could have contributed to the violence of the effects. organized procedures supervision process analysis design of plant/equipment/system isolation of equipment/system",

The two remaining operators, although shocked, can leave uninjured the building. The destruction of a pavilion situated near the border of the site, 50 m away from the building, causes the death of a little girl, 6 years old, after 4 days. In the vicinity of the site, 56 persons receive injuries of different gravity and are hospitalized for care and observations; other 25 are shocked and receive cares on the place. Finally 250 persons are evacuated from their houses, sheltered in a sportive complex and then temporarily relodged. The district heating plant is ravaged by the explosion: 3 boilers are destroyed, the other and the joined equipments are more or less gravely damaged, the bureaus and the control room are collapsed. The majority of the slates covering the building is hurled on the ground and the remains of the bardage and thermic isolant are propelled externally to the site. The electro-filters are seriously damaged, but the chimney doesn't show external dameges. The material damages in the vicinity of the plant are very important: a 3 stories habitation building and two trade buildings (one of 5 stories) are very damaged. Damage of various tens of vehicles (cars). About 600 people were put on technical unemployment. In the nearby buildings the glass of the windows have been broken up to a distance of 2-3 km. The average of the recorded oscillations during 6 min gives a lateral displacement of 1 mm at the level of the 23rd story of the seismologic tower. The building of the Grande Arche is affected with damages on the external structure and on the decoration elements. For safety reasons 3500 civil servants are put in technical unemployment for half a day.

These substances are normally recycled in the plant's washing water, and an aerosol liquid is prepared by drying. The drying phase was very long, and an aerosol outlet nozzle was blocked, causing local overheating. All this, combined with a build-up of the substance at the base of the fluidised bed vaporiser, led to a large amount of substance, including iron sulphites, catching fire. The dust cloud, being within the vaporiser, then caught fire, and the fire spreads to the water washing equipment. The overpressure from the explosion damaged the water pipes. Among the equipment overheated was the valve nearest the water washer, which fell into the silo creating a dust cloud which then caught fire. unexpected reaction/phase-transition Yes",

These factors caused: - strong vibrations of the pump, which caused fatigue stressing and consequently the rupture of a 3/4 inch tapping (connection) placed just above the pump, - a misalignment of the turbine and the pump, which caused a fracture of the shaft and a deterioration of the coupling.An event which contributed to the gravity of the accident was identified. An anomalous delay (of about 10 min) in the closing of the block valve of the feeding pipe of the P3B pump. Actually, if the closing of this valve, which was controlled by the automatic safety system, had been completed within the normal time (of about one minute), the domino effects which involved the other pipe networks could have been avoided, substantially reducing the gravity of the accident. design of plant/equipment/system component/machinery failure/malfunction Yes",

The release is small but the lessons learned with regard to the organisational aspects of the installation are interesting. The accident is therefore notified only for this reason, since the criteria of Annex VI are not fulfilled. The accident is classified at level 0 of the gravity scale, based on the available information.The accident:The accident occurred on the HCN production installations, at the level of a mist separator placed on the residual gas transfer line between the head of the HCN absorption tower and the CNIM boiler.Several incidents had occurred during the previous days:- Problems in extracting liquids at the base of the HCN purification tower (tower H2243) from March 20 to 26 made it necessary to use a second pump. On March 27th, the decision was taken to shutdown the distillation train to clean the HCN polymers that had formed.The shut-down procedure foresaw:- draining the HCN from the train, up to 2% HCN in the drainage water, by directing it toward the ADN unit,- performing air stripping until an HCN concentration is reached which allows the equipment to be opened, the residual gases being burned in the CNIM boiler.On March 28 and 29, the distillation train was drained (shut-down of the HCN converters, as well as the natural gas heaters and the upstream TGN). Draining remained difficult due to extraction problems at the base of tower H2243. On March 29th at 13:00, the decision was taken to switch over to the air stripping phase.The concentration of 1.2% HCN in the towers, measured at the base of tower H2242, was higher than the usual values although it was below the threshold value of 5% tolerated during the operating mode.In compliance with the safety procedures, the workshop was evacuated on March 29th at 16:15 p.m. before the stripping operation was launched. The order to evacuate was cancelled 15 minutes later and 9 people returned to the workshop.The explosion occurred at 16:40 at the level of the mist separator H1191 located at 5 m height on the gas line.The two nearest analysers (Toxguard) located at a distance of 10 and 15 m indicated 30 ppm of HCN; the concentration values dropped after 5 minutes. Other equipment located 100 m from the unit sporadically detected values in the order of 4 to 5 ppm of HCN.The shop personnel were evacuated to a withdrawal zone and the stripping operation was shut down immediately. At 16:45 the unit's Toxguard detector detected a HCN concentration higher than 5 ppm and triggered alarm, the 300 people present in the establishment were ordered to shelter. The on-site emergency plan was put into operation at the same time and the on-site fire-brigade intervened with SCBA (self contained breathing apparatus). Water curtains were set up around the installations.HCN concentrations measured outside the workshop were below 2ppm.The header line of the HCN absorption tower was isolated from tower H2241 at 17:30.

A safe-T-tree was then constructed after having eliminated the highly improbable potential causes: a flashback produced from the boiler was stopped by the separator tank (H1191).According to the operator, the accident was caused by:- the presence of polymers in the tower which slowed down the drainage of HCN, - at the start of the air stripping phase, an operation conducted with an HCN content higher than normal in the residual gases, the normal drainage of the trains not having been conducted, - the presence of several inconsistencies in the implementation procedure:- since 1989, the stripping procedure has consisted of a blocking phase based on a safety threshold level set at 5% HCN in liquid phase. This threshold is erroneous, stripping at 10 C with an HCN concentration &gt; 1.2% in the liquid leading the lower explosive limit (LEL = 6%) of the hydrocyanic acid in gas phase to be reached. At the time of the accident, the HCN concentration of the liquid at the base of tower H2242 was 1.2%, compatible with the threshold.- the sample of liquid analysed at the base of tower H2242, containing 1.2% HCN, was not representative of the real HCN amount of the train.A posteriori, the average concentration of the amount analysed was 2%.- the gas phase HCN analyser present at the tower head was not adapted and did not allow the operators to be alerted. The device was limited to normal operating ranges: alarm at 0.9% and no measurement beyond 1.2%.- the operating mode did not explicitly indicate the action to be taken for a concentrationgreater than 0.9%.By reducing the air outputs, the operators:- reduced the speed of the gases in the line toward the boiler,- promoted flashback,- increased the HCN content in the air and the risk of exceeding the L.E.L. organized procedures process analysis design of plant/equipment/system Yes",

The regular treatment operation is carried out as follows: - After being prepared, the batch is introduced into the furnace, in a single operation;- The electric arc, with the electrodes above the batch, melts the batch;- Gaseous oxygen is blown into the molten material through a lance, for refining;- The electric arc is turned off, while the refining operation still goes on;- The furnace is tipped, the slag swimming on top is removed from the furnace, the metal is poured into ingots. The electric arc furnace is started up at 7:35 by the fusion of metalscraps containing mainly iron, molybdenum and cobalt (3210 kg) and oldiron (1080 kg).The processing was carried out without incidents, and the liquid metal was poured at 12:40 into ingots of about 800 kg.The furnace was completely emptied of liquid metal.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The main factual data relative to the circumstances are as follows :- The level of the metal bath was abnormally high. The furnace-operator had to raise the level of the dam and slightly incline the furnace spout.- Solid products came to the surface of the metal bath when oxygen was being blown in.- The furnace-man noted unmelted parts in the bottom of the furnace (by testing with a metal rod) a few minutes before the accident.- There were no unmelted elements attached to the sides of the furnace.- The average thickness of the arch bricks was measured at 180mm. The new brick is 250mm thick.- A few bricks of the arch's outer row were found on the periphery of the arch's metal ring.- A sample of metal ejected by the furnace door was analysed :.- The examination of the off-gas recorder on the stack outlet highlights the rapid increase of CO content at the time of the accident.- No water leak was reported in the cooling systems and the refractory material of the hearth was in very good condition.- While the load remaining in the furnace was melting after the accident, melting difficulties and rapid temperature increases to 1,700  C followed by abrupt drops to 1,550  C were noted. The temperature rise/drop phenomenon was noted 2 to 3 times. This phenomenon is interpreted by the dissolution of unmelted products in the bottom of the furnace and their rise to the top.Based on testimony by the personnel, reconstruction of the previous casting operation through to just after the accident, and post-accident investigations, some hypotheses relative to the phenomenon observed were presented. After analysis, some of them were finally rejected (Water leak inside the furnace, presence of a hollow body, collapse of the arch, collapse of unmelted elements attached to the side of the furnace, water present in the slag tank).On the other hand, the following causes have been retained :- The nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace did not melt completely; the intense mixing of the metal by the injection of gaseous oxygen helped the nickeled sand rise to the surface. The nickel oxide was deoxidised by passing through the metal; the oxygen thus released combined with the carbon present in the bath and produced large quantities of CO and CO2 very rapidly. This hypothesis is substantiated by the recording of the gas analysers; a calculation shows that this reaction produces 73 m3 of CO in a few seconds.- The unmelted nickel sand in the bottom of the furnace contained a certain quantity of water and gas, held under pressure by a layer of pasty metal. The blast would have been due to the release of these during the fusion operation was an aggravating factor in the number of people injured. gases; a calculation shows that this phenomenon generates 8 m3 of steam.- The analysis of the causes concludes that the loading method (nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace) was the origin of the accident.The presence of personnel not necessarily required around the furnace aggravated the consequences of the accident in term of human victims. unexpected reaction/phase-transition Yes",

Nine persons were injured: 6 members of the on-site fire-brigade and, 3 members of the off-site fire-brigades (including a bone fracture which occurred while removing equipment after the fire was extinguished).The accident was contained to building O 24, due to the successful measures adopted by the fire fighters to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby buildings (namely a laboratory, oil and storage warehouses, and an electric transformer unit).Property damage was extensive. Most part of the damaged building will have to be demolished. 1.415 tonnes of gum were affected by the fire. The only important machine present in the building, an automatic weight-dosing machine (MAC BU), separated from the fire by a wall, and the majority of the chemical products were protected by the firemen and not damaged. The economic consequences were relatively limited. Only the buffer stocks of raw materials and a large portion of building O24 were destroyed. No essential installation was affected. Technical unemployment was not considered and the MAC BU machine was rapidly placed back into service.From the beginning of the occurrence it was possible to state that, in all likelihood, the nature of the materials involved into the combustion process would present limited toxic hazards, although the size of the fire and the incomplete combustion would cause a spectacular smoke plume rich in unburned particles (soot).The fire department performed a few basic air quality tests, in the immediate proximity of the fire, without detecting toxic compounds. The ATMO network for the air quality monitoring of the Auvergne region did not detect any dramatic increases of air pollutants. The air quality remained below thresholds over the urban area. However, there were numerous requests for information. - The real-time measurements starting from January 21st, 2000, - the mobile laboratory of the ATMO network set-up along the axis followed by the smoke cloud, - and additional measurements, on dust and particle fallout, performed by an approved organisation over the following weeks,confirmed that at the highest pollution peak, the concentrations of dust in the ambient air, outside the smoke cloud, remained much below the average daily exposition threshold recommended by WHO.All measurements data gathered until now confirm that the cloud caused a few temporary increases of dust and sulphur dioxide concentrations. Particle fallout remained very localised. The values measured remained below concentrations which can occur during unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of urban pollutants- thermal inversion anticyclonic period #No major impact was measured during or after the fire (death to fish, plant life, etc.). Afterwards, large monitoring campaigns have been carried out in order to analyse and evaluate non visible effects. The results are detailed in the paragraph Actions taken.

The logistic service, 4 employees and 3 subcontractors, is in charge of these sheds. The sheds, built between 1920 and 1938, were used to store bulk fertilizers and package ammonium nitrate until 1981. Since 1981, shed 221 stores agricultural or industrial nitrate considered below grade owing to their grain size and off-spec chemical composition. The others neighbouring sheds are still used for packaging. From the various workshops, this rejected material is brought to an inlet area by three subcontractors. It is then pushed by transport equipment into the building to be bulk stored. This scrap material is removed periodically and oriented to the SOFERTI plants (ATO Group) in Toulouse and Bordeaux to be recycled to be used the manufacture of complex fertilizers",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  At 10.17 am, a severe explosion (detonation) occurred in shed 221. The detonation, felt several kilometres away, corresponded to a magnitude of 3.4 on the Richter scale. Significant dust fallout from the installations and a crater were observed outside the plant. A large cloud of dust from the detonation and red smoke drifted to the north-west. The appearance of the smoke is linked to the emergency shutdown of the nitric acid manufacturing installation. Before rapidly dissipating, the cloud containing ammonia and nitrogen oxides sickened witnesses who complained of eye and throat irritations. The atmospheric pollutants released after the detonation lead to the formation of nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from ammonium nitrate. As a precautionary measure, the local governmental authority (\u201cPr\u00e9fecture\u201d) requested that the population of Toulouse confine themselves to their homes. This measure, the efficiency of which was limited owing to the damage to numerous homes, nevertheless reduced the number of traffic problems after the accident. From a strictly technical point of view, and according to the measures and observations made by the experts, it should be noted that the detonation gave rise to an overpressure in the order of 140 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the lethal effects in the danger studies) at a distance between 280 and 350 m and 50 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the irreversible effects on human health in the danger studies) at a distance between 680 and 860 m. This observation can be constructively compared to the fact that there were victims resulting from indirect effects up to 500 m away on the one hand, and injuries caused by broken glass at distances of a few kilometres away, on the other hand. True False False False gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air explosive decomposition (of unstable material)",
        "causes_description": "causes:  On the eve of the explosion, 15 to 20 tons of ammonium nitrates with an additive in qualification phase was brought into shed 221. On the morning of the explosion, products derived from the packaging of the ammonium nitrates and the manufacturing shops were also transferred into the shed. The last addition of material by bin coming from another storage zone was made less than 30 min before the explosion Several inquiries and expert evaluations were conducted: - judicial inquiry, - administrative inquiry conducted by the French Ministry of the Environment with the participation of industrial hazard experts [3], -ATOFINA (mother group) internal inquiry, - inquiry by the CHSCT (the plant committee for hygiene, safety and working conditions). Many hypotheses were formulated to explain the explosion: Unintentional external causes associated with accidental technological or natural phenomena (methane due to underground bacterial activity, lightning, meteorite, falling aircraft parts, explosion of a bomb or nitrocellulose underground following previous site activity); all of these hypotheses proved to be unfounded. Intentional external causes (attack, malicious mischief, missile) conjured up and spread by public opinion in the same context as the Twin Towers terrorist attack in New York, on September 11, 2001. From a legal standpoint, this hypothesis is not supported by any tangible facts. A process incident (an internal electrical fault at the plant, electric arc, missile effect from a part projected at high speed\u2026). An examination of manufacturing parameters at the time of accident would not however explain this type of incident. Concerning the possible high speed projection of a piece of metal causing a primary explosion in a filter at the top of a tower near the site of the explosion, experts feel that the kinetic energy developed by the projection of debris from the filter would be insufficient to cause the nitrate contained in shed 221 to explode.As far as an accidental chemical reaction is concerned, the nitrates used were polluted by iron oxides, sulphur and in contact with bitumen used to pave the floor of shed 221 or following the mixture of incompatible chemical substances, such as ammonium nitrate with sodium dichlorocyanurate (NaDCC, a product used in treating swimming pools); the incompatibility of these substances was highlighted during court-ordered laboratory tests. Favoured differently by the entities concerned, none of these hypotheses have lead to a consensus. In may 2006, the final report presented by the expert investigators to the plaintiffs supports the theory of a chemical accident, attributing the causes of the disaster to an unfortunate combination of a few dozen kilos of sodium dichlorocyanurate with 500 kg of ammonium nitrate spilled on the main nitrate pile 20 minutes before the detonation. It is worth noticing that, since the very beginning of the industrial manufacturing of nitrogenous fertilisers early in the 20th century, ammonium nitrate have been involved in several major industrial accidents while being stored or dispatched . On July 26, 1921 in Kriewald (formerly German Silesia), the dislodging of wagons filled with ammonium nitrate using explosives caused a detonation killing 19. Less than 2 months later, on September 21st, in Germany's Oppau plant, blasting work on a pile of aggregated fertiliser mix containing ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate produced a detonation responsible for 561 deaths, 1,952 injured and the near total destruction of the town. Twenty years after that, in Belgium, explosives were still being used to disaggregate a pile of ammonium nitrate, resulting in another several hundred deaths at Tessenderlo. Despite the production of coated nitrate to subsequently avoid nitrate aggregation, several detonations of ammonium nitrate still occurred either in France or abroad, thus confirming the complex characteristics (e.g. chemical composition, particle distribution, density, humidity) associated with these categories of products and their detonation potential under circumstances promoting their instability: mixing, hazardous outcome when reacting with other materials or pollutants, temperature, containment\u2026 Yes",

Health professionals were recommended to conduct hearing deficiency examinations on the individuals who were within a radius of 1.7 km at the time of the explosion. The NO2, the NH3 and the particles released by the explosion were responsible for transitory ocular (conjunctivitis, vision disabilities\u2026) and respiratory irritations (tracheobronchitis\u2026) in the population living near the site. These problems appeared to decrease within 5 weeks after the accident. However, the collected data allow to establish the absence of significant health effects potentially associated with these substances in the short and long term. According to the heath services and considering toxicological and epidemiological knowledge on the exposure-hazard relationship, it appears that there are no disquieting consequences concerning the health risk associated with the release of asbestos (cancers, fibrosis). However, labour protection regulations must be carefully applied for individuals working on site cleanup operations. The water monitoring system allows any alteration in raw water quality and the water distributed in the hours following the catastrophe to be detected. The occasional overshoot of quality limit values for NH4+, NO3- and NO2- do not represent a health risk for consumers. The risks associated with soil contamination (soil thrown from the crater), both direct and indirect (food) have been disregarded. Psychological traumas are also registered: more than 8,000 people consulted their general practitioner for acute post-traumatic stress in the weeks following the explosion. Five thousand people began a psychotropic treatment (anxiolytic, antidepressant, hypnotic). According to the experts, these numbers are underestimated as they only take into account the individuals who sought medical care. The explosion had a major impact on psychological problems (depression, anxiety\u2026). In addition, two studies conducted jointly with the French National Educational Service show that one year after the accident, one out of seven students still displays clear signs of post-traumatic stress. Continued monitoring of the medium and long-term health effects will be conducted via various elements of the epidemiological system: a cross-section study (a descriptive epidemiological study at time t) concerning approximately 50,000 salaried employees of the greater Toulouse community and 5,000 rescue personnel, on the one hand, and monitoring of a cohort of 5,000 salaried employees derived from this study (biological examinations), on the other hand. Finally, long-term analysis is planned to identify the causes of death (changes in the mortality rate) of the employees who agreed to give their addresses during the initial study. The information systems of the heath care structures which supplied the data are independent from one another and the existing databases cannot be interconnected when they exist. A person may be recorded in several of these systems without it being possible to detect the error and may be counted more than once. Also, the results do not allow precise quantitative estimates to be made regarding the overall number of different troubles observed. In addition to the physical and psychological traumas suffered by the population of Toulouse, there are significant social disturbances notably linked to the destruction and damage to homes, community equipment, buildings, technical unemployment, and to the loss of work\u2026 Associations and a collective have been organised to combat industrial hazards and to defend the interests of the populations concerned. ECONOMIC extensive property damage and production losses for the plant operator, neighbouring plants, retails and individuals, cost of clean-up and rehabilitation measures of the area (total cost estimated above 2 billions euros).Nearly 1,300 companies, representing approximately 20,000 employees, claimed losse. The shock wave and various projectiles damaged 82 schools, 19 middle schools and 15 high schools (36,000 students), as well as 4 establishments of higher education and 3 university dormitories. In front of the factory, a depot containing roughly one hundred busses was destroyed (30,5 M\u20ac) and numerous other store were damaged. A household appliance store located 320 m from the explosion's epicentre, as well as a vehicle maintenance facility at 380 m, collapsed also claiming victims. A total of 25,550 homes were damaged to various degrees, 11,180 of which were seriously damaged. More than one thousand homes were completely destroyed and more than 1,200 had to be relocated immediately."

The personnel distributed 50 kg of potassium permanganate dust on the tank bottom and transferred by gravity approximately 13m3 of alcohol in the tank. The personnel left the storage facility after finishing this operation at about 16:35 hrs.At 16:42(t=0), the tank F10 containing 13 m3 of alcohol exploded projecting its roof more than 10 m up in the air. The tank-roof fell on the roof of tank F8 with a capacity of 1500 m3 (empty when the accident occurred). The retention basin of the two tanks, called basin B, and tank F10 were on fire.At 16:52 (t= +10 min) explosion of the empty tank MG11 with a capacity of 540 m3 occurred. The roof was projected some 30 m away onto a nearby limestone pile . The safety managers of the distillery were alerted by the first explosions and activated the fixed fire-fighting means from the extinguishing system pump house - the fire monitor of the alcohol storage installation was set to foam position,- the spray rings on top of the adjacent silos were activated in water position - the spray rings on top of the tanks of the alcohol storage installation could be set on demand to either water or foam, this operation could be performed from the distribution stations located near the tanksOn request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE), the company requested the French National Institute of Industrial Environment and Risks (INERIS) to investigate the accident causes. The results of the investigation found that the explosion of Tank F10 was caused by the ignition of an explosive atmosphere (ATEX - ATmosph\u00e8re EXplosive) consisting of a mixture of alcohol vapours and air which had formed under the tank roof.The ignition was caused by a strongly exothermic reaction of an excess amount of potassium permanganate (KMNO4) reacting with a 96% hydro-alcoholic solution of ethanol. The domino effect increased the consequences of the accident damaging other tanks.The report is based specifically on the results of a laboratory test which showed that a heterogeneous mixture of KMNO4 and ethanol in the proportions present in the tank causes an exothermic reaction capable of igniting an explosive atmosphere above the surface formed by ethanol/air. Mixing permanganate with ethanol was a procedure, which had been adopted since the storage installation was put into service in 1980 without causing any significant incident, in order to reduce the content of sulphur compounds in the alcohol.",

Generally, the pipe-line is permanently filled with light fuel oil between two transfer phases.The pipes are made out of 5,56 mm thick steel and have an internal section of 100 mm, the pipe-line is 7430 m long and is made of 12 m elements which are welded together at their ends. The pipe is covered with a 3 mm resin sleeve glued on the metal, a 5 cm insulation layer of polyurethane and finally another sleeve identical to the first oneThe operating pressures are 40 bar for normal operation and 90 bar for forced operation in case of cooling of heavy fuel oil during decanting. The pipeline has been tested with 102 bar when it was put into service and during inspections every ten years.The transfer procedure from the intermediate storage facility to the power station is the following one:- pumping of light fuel-oil for 4 hours at 70  C and 10 bar in order to heat the pipe walls and avoid incrustations;- pumping of the heavy fuel oil heated to 85  C with a starting pressure of 40 bar, the pressure drops to 36 bar during transfer operation when the pipe walls reach steady state temperature- - pumping of cold light fuel oil at 20 bar to rinse the pipeline. - filling of the pipeline with light fuel oil without any pressure between two transfer operations; in fact the pressure in the pipeline section towards the coast ( where the accident occurred) is approximately 2 bar. This static pressure is due to the level difference between the location of the power station and the coast (pressure column).The transfer operations are performed by the personnel of the storage installation located near the intermediate storage facility which by contract is operated by the same personnel.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The pollution was caused by a leakage which occurred during the days preceding the detection of the release, a provisory repair was performed, the transfer operations of heavy fuel oil were performed from then on under increased control.The programme set up to investigate the occurrence was organised as follows:- visual investigation;- chemical analysis;- micrographic (microscopic); - testing with an electronic micro-analyser probe.The chemical analysis confirmed that the steel analysed corresponded to the specifications defined for constructing the pipe-line.The micrographic test performed near the piercing showed a significant thickness reduction of the pipe wall and several corrosion points. It was found that at the level of the piercing point the material was torn. Several corrosion craters were also found outside the area around the piercing point.On the other hand the presence of oxides on the external wall of the pipe and on the ripped borders makes it plausible that the leakage was not recent.The tests with an electronic micro-analyser probe on the oxides found externally to the pipe-line wall showed the presence of chlorides.These investigations led the operator to the following conclusions:- the piercing of the pipe-wall was due to a significant loss of thickness of the pipe-walls;- the generalised external corrosion of corresponding pipe-section was caused by chlorides; - brackish water was present because of changes in the watershed-level and contamination of the water shed with sea water; - and finally a localised failure of the pipe-protection were the originating causes of the occurrence.The assumption of the contamination of the watershed with sea-water was confirmed by the institution of hydro-geological experts of the Department of southern Corsica. Changes of the water-shed level were significant, rising several metres over a few days up to above ground level. vessel/container/containment-equipment failure corrosion/fatigue",

The validity of this estimate is questionable due to the fact that it is unknown when exactly the spillage started."

The cells consist of a composite structure made up of a reinforced concrete frame filled with hollow bricks. The cells are located in a building with a metal structure; the walls and the roof are made of metal sheet and fibro-cement.The handling tower is 20 m high. It consists of two elements: the bottom part is formed by a pit with reinforced concrete casing and the upper part consists of a lightweight structure with a metal frame covered by corrugated galvanised metal sheeting. The structure is equipped with two elevators. The roofing of the structure is made with corrugated fibro-cement panels on a metal framework.The delivery/shipping station is placed alongside the gable of the silos but there is no communication between them.

The raw materials are stored in silos before grinding and mixing operations. The finished product is then sent in bulk or in bags.The site is classified with an authorisation, issued with prefectoral order of 19th June 1989, mainly for grinding vegetable substances. The site does not fall within the scope of the Seveso Directive.The accident: A violent explosion occurred in correspondence with the handling tower.The accident is classified at level 2 of the accident gravity scale due to the fact that one employee died as a result of the explosion.This kind of accident is unfortunately not an exceptional event. The accident is notified with the objective of ensuring that this kind of situation is better known and taken more into consideration.The accidentAt 10:00 h on 14th May 2001 a truck arrived at the plant to deliver 29 t of colza press cakes. The driver started unloading operations in the receiving pit of the brick silo (storage hangar).At the same time two workers started working on the delivery redler conveyor of the brick silo, trying to repair the scraper driving chain. The repair operation consisted in cutting the chain and welding some links after removing the redler conveyor cover on the side facing the pit.A violent explosion occurred at 11:15 h.The truck driver who was near the discharging platform was slightly burned. The two workers in the pit were seriously injured (3rd degree burns). One worker managed to get out of the pit on his own. He activated the emergency shut-down switch of the handling tower. His colleagues made him sit on a chair while waiting for the emergency response service. The emergency response service arrived approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The other worker was lying unconscious in the pit. He was brought out after 1/2 hour by the fire brigade.The explosion was heard in the neighbourhood and was followed by a fire in the pit, in the hopper and in the areas of the tower and the gallery above the cells.The hot gases and/or incandescent particles ignited the dust deposits in the air circulation system of the cylindrical silos located a few meters away but a few meters above the horizontal silos. The fire fighters were alerted by the smoke plumes and intervened rapidly to fight the fire, thus avoiding the propagation of the fire to the vertical cylindrical storage cells.The explosion blew over half the roofing of the structure away and tore the walls of the tower open. Pieces of fibro-cement roofing panels were found at 30 m distance and several metal rods of the staircase giving access to the vertical silos were severed.The descending duct of the bucket conveyor employed for the silage of the press cakes was ripped open over a length of 4 m at the bottom of the pit section as well as at 2/3 height of the tower. False False False False",
        "causes_description": "causes:  The accident originated from infringing the basic prevention rules for grain storage installations.Cleaning operations of the premises had not been performed. Large quantities of grain and dust accumulated in the pits, on all surfaces, forming layers which in some places reached several dozens of centimetres.A maintenance operation involving metal welding and grinding was performed in a confined space, a fire permit was signed as a pure formality without performing any cleaning operation. The workers performed the operation on the delivery redler conveyor while the elevator bucket conveyor was operating. Inside the bucket conveyor the atmosphere was saturated with dust.The discharging operation of the truck was almost concluded and welding and grinding operations had been finished when the explosion occurred.Based on the analysis of the elements gathered on the accident site and tests performed, the competent authorities consider the following accident scenario as most probable:- Initially several metal particles deriving from the grinding operations were projected and fell * either on the bottom of the pit igniting one or more combustion spots .........* or in the chutes of the conveyor before coming into contact with the dusty atmosphere of the descending side of an elevator. Holes have been found in some junction boxes and switching boxes of the handling equipment which may have allowed such a pathway.- Following this* a primary explosion occurred in a descending duct of the elevator (conveyor) at the level of the handling tower pit;* the explosion in the elevator spread to the handling tower pit due to suspension of the dust present in the pit; * the rupture of the shell of the descending duct of the elevator in correspondence with the second level of the handling tower propagated the explosion throughout the entire tower.* at the same time the explosion in the pit affected the upper part of the tower through the openings* the explosion of the tower spread towards the rest of the storage and the roofing structure.The pit in which the explosion occurred is a strategic maintenance node were the feeding and extraction systems serving the entire silo system of the company are localised and are in communication.As far as the operator is concerned the most probable cause of the accident was a blocked rotating element of the elevator which may have caused the explosion by overheating.

After a few days, the cyclohexane spill was in four forms in the subsoil: - A pool of cyclohexane floating at the top of the water table, representing 70 to 85% of the tonnage spilt from the leak;- Cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action representing 15 to 30 % of the tonnage spilt;- Cyclohexane dissolved in the water table (less than 1 % of the tonnage spilt);- Cyclohexane in gaseous form in the subsoil (less than 1% of the tonnage spilt).The pool of floating cyclohexane accounted for the largest part of the cyclohexane spilt. It was also the source of supply for the cyclohexane captured in the subsoil by capillary action, the cyclohexane dissolved in the water table and the cyclohexane present in gaseous form. The pollution of the water table, one of the biggest in the region in the last 10 years, is a risk of contamination for mains drinking water catchments and agricultural bore holes located below it. The cyclohexane did not catch fire or explode. The flash point was not reached. The overall cost of the leak and the actions that followed is estimated at 2 M euros."

        "causes_description": "causes:  At 4.15 a.m. on 10 September 2002, a fire was detected in the mine by miners on shift in adjoining shafts. As the walls are not airtight between the working shafts and the storage centre, the operatives were alerted by an abnormal smell. The fire was located in storage block n  15 where 1,800 t of waste is stored: drums of soil polluted with arsenic, big-bags of household waste incineration bottom ash and industrial waste incineration bottom ash , big-bags of waste from asbestos removal work and big-bags of asbestos residues from a fire in a pesticide warehouse.The precise causes of the fire are not known. Several hypotheses have however been put forward, including: - The presence of waste that was still hot such as of household waste incineration bottom ash or industrial waste incineration bottom ash,- The presence of prohibited waste, especially flammable waste,- The presence of products incompatible with one another and/or that could develop incompatibility at mine temperature. So there is a presumption that waste classified as containing asbestos from a fire in a pesticide storage building, as this waste arrived packed in big-bags (the big-bags were not opened on arrival due to the asbestos hazard).

Significant concentrations of sulphur dioxide were measured discharging into the atmosphere, at the air return shafts. The installation of barrages enabled smoke emissions from the shafts to be rapidly reduced. Analyses of micro-pollutants, made on samples taken at several places and in particular in the environment (soil and plants), did not reveal any notable impact. The main values exceeding the standards allowed concerned two carcinogen pollutants, benzene and benzo(a)pyrene. Subsequent analyses for those 2 pollutants on smoke captured in block 15 seem to conclude that the emissions were of short duration. Significant quantities of dioxins and furans on the walls of tunnels close to block 15, at a depth of 600 m, but no contamination was found on the surface.No effects were found on the health of people living near the plant. At the time of the accident, the public were not asked to stay indoors but three nearby schools were closed, as a precaution. However several miners exposed to smoke at the time complained of skin problems and throat irritations. These assessments were confirmed by the panel of experts appointed by the local information and monitoring commission (CLIS) which concluded that there was no particular risk to local people, the public or surface staff and reported that several emergency service crew members showed clinical signs of slight intoxication with carbon monoxide, skin disorders and digestive problems that required medical attention.Initially, the fire caused work to be suspended at the storage centre and adjoining mine: thus 27 storage employees and 350 miners were laid off. Subsequently, it ultimately marked the permanent ending of operation of the centre. The future of the 40,000 t of waste stored down the mine has not yet been decided. Moreover, the ending of potash extraction, which should have been in April 2003, was brought forward by 6 months."

All pyrotechnic waste materials could only be transferred to the incineration area after authorisation given the safety and environmental protection service. The waste materials of the company and/or other companies were transported to the area soaked in water. It was necessary to reduce the water content in the waste materials up to a certain degree in order to proceed with burning , this operation was performed by adding powder charges to the waste pyrotechnic materials. Before incineration in the excavated area., waste material was placed in a string disposition on pallets The presence of a specially adapted fire extinguishing vehicle was mandatory for burning large quantities of waste materials.

        "location_description": "units:  The manufacture of titanium oxide starts from a blend of natural mineral (ilmenite) and steelworks slag that contains a variable quantity of TiO2. The process can be summarised as a succession of operations that enable it to be extracted and then purified.Treating these minerals with sulphuric acid (also made at the site) generates acid effluent. Part of the acid process water (the most acidic, known as primary water) is carried, via an 18 km long pipe (DN300 mm), to the Hode site to be treated, before being discharged into the Seine.The other part of the acidic water (named secondary water, at a rate of about 14,700 m#/d) was discharged via a diffuser into Seine Bay, without special treatment. The operator was intending, from 31 July 2002, to send its water to the Hode neutralisation station, via a second 18 km pipe made of LFG (laminated fibreglass) installed in 2001-2002 (DN 400 mm LFG pipe).Both pipes carrying acidic water are installations connected to classified facilities but are also covered by the 6 December 1982 ministerial order setting out technical regulations for pipes carrying fluids under pressure other than hydrocarbons and combustible gases. In this respect, the 3 September 2001 prefect's order authorising the extension of the Hode facilities imposes on the operator specific requirements for installing and operating the DN 400 LFG pipe. The DN 400 LFG pipe was installed in accordance with the technical provisions required by the 6 December 1982 order, namely, pipework appropriate to running conditions (type of fluid, temperature and pressure) and assemblies correctly performed and inspected. The pipe, for which the calculation pressure is 10 bar (for a working pressure of about 4 bar) successfully passed the water pressure test at 15 bar on 16 July 2002.On 31 July 2002, in accordance with the Prefect's 3 September 2001 approval, the discharge into Seine Bay of slightly acid effluent was stopped and the effluent was sent to Hode in the new pipe, from the beginning of the week of 5 August 2002.",

However, as the pipe belongs to a Low Threshold Seveso site, it was notified under MARS as an other event.The event was classified level 3 of the scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive (cost of repairs in excess of 5.8 Meuros).The accident:On 7 August 2002 at 12.01 a.m., the pipe monitoring system (linebalance) detected a leak of 100 m#/h (out of a nominal flow of 500m#/h) of secondary water (dilute sulphuric acid: concentration lessthan or equal to 15 g/l of sulphate), at a pressure of 5 bars. Aninspection was made by the operator on the ground and in all ducts overthe whole route of the pipe in order to identify the leak. Assessed atabout 20 m#, the leak was due to fissuring on 40 cm of a pipe withinthe boundaries of the Le Havre plant. After the faulty section had beenreplaced, the whole of the pipe was tested again and the facilityreturned to operation.Four days later, on Sunday 11 August 2002 at 8.05 p.m. a new leakoccurred which the monitoring system at once detected. The nominal flowwas then 440 m#/h (dilute sulphuric acid), at a pressure of 3.9 bars(these conditions are however lower than the maximum running conditionsand lower still than the test conditions). The leak was located outsidethe Le Havre plant, in an underground part of the pipeline, close towhere it runs under a railway line behind the LPG storage and fillingcentre. The leak was assessed at between 100 and 200 m#. In total, between 5 August and 11 August 2002, eight defects werefound, six of them on the first two kilometres of pipe. Two defectsoccurred during operation, under similar conditions, near to bends andat changes of direction, yet this pipeline had only run a few dozenhours under operating conditions where the pressure had never exceeded5 bars in a dilute sulphuric acid environment (concentration less than15g/l) and at a temperature of under 35 C (temperature allowed for LFGpipes 50 C). As from 11 August 2002, the pipe was shut down for generic failure.Experts were appointed by both the owner and the operator in order todetermine the reasons for the failure of the pipe. In November 2002 andJanuary 2003, leak detection tests using a mixture of nitrogen + heliumrevealed two further leaks. False False False False fluid release to ground",
        "causes_description": "causes:  All of the defects found on the pipe were similar in terms of:- The main direction of fissuring: lengthways in the bottom part of the pipe (lower part of the curve),- Location: close to a singular zone, namely change of gradient or angle (45 , 30 , 22 , 11  bends or high point).It was clearly demonstrated that the damage to the pipe was due to a mechanism of stress corrosion in an acid environment. Stress corrosion is a fissuring mechanism that requires a combination of the following three factors:- A stress (or permanent distortion),- A material sensitive to the phenomenon,- A corrosive environment.All of the basic data for the pipeline specification was analysed by experts appointed subsequent to the failures in the pipe. The investigation produced several findings:- Soil / structure interaction As regards the soil, the specification for the pipe required minimum compacting for the bed and sides. Now soil tests made around the pipeline showed compacting values lower than those specified. The pipe thus became more oval in places than the maximum acceptable value.- Hydraulic specification In order to protect the pipeline both from excess pressure (water hammer on start-up) and from negative pressure (pumping stop / start stage), a 20 m3 water hammer protection chamber was installed at the start of the line. To be effective, it was specified that the chamber should be pre-pressurised at 0.5 bar; now on testing following the various incidents, it was found that the chamber had been ore-pressurised at 1.7 bar. The whole of the pipeline thus suffered a more violent pressure drop when pumping stopped (the greatest negative pressure having occurred in the first two kilometres). Similarly, the potential existence of air at high points, because of the absence of vents at the highest points, could have had the same hydraulic consequences, from both excess pressure and negative pressure. - Life of composite pipelines The design curve for the pipeline as regards the risk from stress corrosion supplemented with some experimental values in the field of substantial distortion shows that the burst-time for composite pipelines is a few dozen hours for substantial distortions.The failures occurred near to or at high points and close to a change of direction, which confirms the role of hydraulic transitions. Some failures occurred in a zone where it is difficult to have correct soil compacting (pipeline near to the water table and concrete bore holes). Lastly, most of the failures (6 out of 8) occurred in the first two kilometres, which is the area where hydraulic forces are highest. corrosion/fatigue Yes",
        "consequences_description": "consequences:  Other - soil pollution material losses - pipework repair for 2 kilometres, moving the outfall pipe etc All soil polluted by the various leaks was treated with sodium carbonate and used as backfill for trenches.

The accident was notified because of the cost of the damage to facilities (4.3 MEuros). It was classified level 3 of the scale, as published in February 1994 by the Committee of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso directive, in accordance with that criterion.The accident:A leak occurred at the reboiler seal surface, on the hot fluid side, and immediately ignited causing an almost vertical plume of flame a dozen metres long.The purpose of the reboiler is to provide the energy necessary for the column to operate. The column consists of the pre-treatment stripper, depending on the hydrotreatment unit. It is a preparation phase for the reformer input. The reboiling energy is provided by the output from the reformer.The sequence of events:The settings (pressure and associated throughputs) on the two circuits, analysed after the accident, show that the leak occurred on the hot fluid side (thus containing output from the reformer). The description of the sequence of events is as follows:- 20h23: Fire started,- 20h25: West units called to the fire. Site siren triggered.- 20h30: Fire-fighters left - Emergency stop of the reformer - closure of shut-off valves due to fault - Start of decompression of the unit - gas sent to the flare- 20h32: Stand-by management called and home phone connection made (stage 1)- 20h34: Stand-by management called and home phone connection made (stage 2)- 20h50: Head of safety/security arrives.- 20h55: Nangis fire brigade arrives (1 fire engine +5 crew) tasked with installing a second cannon on the west side.- 20h56: Departmental fire and rescue service called to report the sending of reinforcements- 21h00: Mormant fire brigade arrives (5 fire-fighters) tasked with preparing two 1,000 l/min fire hoses.- 21h10: A carpet of foam laid down.- 21h11: Water curtain with cannon to the West of the area on fire- 21h35: Deviation set up by the police on the RN19 trunk road- 21h45: Pre-positioning of a 4th canon, which was not used.- 23h21: Fire put out and 3 cannons stopped - 2 cannons were kept in place for a time either side of the unit.- 23h25: Deviation on the RN 19 trunk road ceased- 23h30: Fire-fighters stood down - Facilities inerted with nitrogen.- 1h00: End of emergency.As regards the offsite emergency response services, the fire brigade was called by motorists passing the site. Subsequently, 20 fire engines were parked in front of the refinery, as the refinery only authorised 2 fire engines to enter the site, for safety reasons.

        "causes_description": "causes:  According to the initial findings and reports, the leak was due to a fault originating in the exchanger which had a dimensional concentricity defect in the throat of the seal housing. This had caused problems with the work of reassembling the unit while stopped for maintenance prior to the accident. It was because the different parts were incorrectly seated.The seal, obtained by cold tightening the metal parts onto one another, gave way during the run-up to high temperatures. The accident thus occurred during this transition phase. maintenance/repair vessel/container/containment-equipment failure Yes",

There was considerable property damage: damage to the facility amounted to 4.3 Meuros. Furthermore, the main units affected (hydrogen processing and reforming) were shut down for several weeks. Lastly, because of the significant damage, the technical refurbishment and mitigation plan for the area affected resulted to be massive. The cost of business interruption came to 1.7 Meuros."

These investigations are still going on. The difficulty in looking for the causes of this kind of accident comes from the absence of direct witnesses and the destruction of the material elements. In this particular case two elements have contributed somewhat to reducing this difficulty: a witness went several times into the workshop during the hour immediately before the explosion (the worker of one of the kneading machine workshops who personally brought the paste containers to workshop no. 50) and the area around the Rollex machine was filmed by 4 cameras for monitoring operations from the control room and the images were registered. The analysis of the registrations shows that the initial explosion occurred in the feeder of the Rollex machine and then propagated to the other explosives present in the workshop. The explosion may have been caused by the presence of a foreign body in the feeder, which may have got stuck between the extruder screws and the metal body of the feeder. The experts cannot exclude a certain sensitivity of the dynamite although tests performed on the explosives produced when the accident occurred did not show anything abnormal. Yes",

        "causes_description": "causes:  The triggering event that released the detonation of the bombs located in the storage area is not known. The only two people working on filling the bombs in this building were the victims, their bodies being found some fifteen metres away.As of today, different investigations are in progress regarding this accident:- a judicial investigation (a criminal investigation assisted by a laboratory of the scientific police);- an administrative investigation.The effect of the explosion of building 9 was surprising. There was a detonation, although the behaviour expected of the products present in the storage facility where the detonation occurred was:- rapid, highly intense flame without any significant blast, in accordance with the classification 1.3 of these products as defined in the pyrotechnic regulations in force.The zones of effects determined by the operator in the safety assessment initially performed were not more than 20 m for the lethal effect zone and 38 m for the irreversible effect zone.Considering the consequences of the accident, an expert advice bureau concluded that the detonation was equivalent to 15 to 30 kg of TNT. The shockwave recalculated on the basis of these assumption indicates a maximum extent of the radios for the lethal effect zone and the irreversible effect zone respectively in the order of 40 m and 70 m.In view of observations made on the ground it is possible that one of the 2 persons, or possibly both, were inside the candle loading room at the time (9B2).It is also possible that this operation was being conducted at the same time as the manufacture of the bombs (forbidden procedure).Hypotheses concerning the circumstances:The formation of a crater inside the storage area indicates that a considerable quantity of products detonated. Investigations finally took 3 potential causes into consideration:- the risk presented by the products usually stored in this area may have been wrongly assessed (the risk of detonation had not been taken into account). It is customary in this branch of activity to classify stars and small-diameter bombs as non-detonating products. As these products are not sold as they stand, the operator did not charge an approved certification body to perform the necessary testing procedures for classification. Storing the products in bulk and in a confined space may support the hypothesis of detonating product behaviour. Nevertheless the ignition remains unknown.- The products stored were exposed to a violent shock and the energy absorbed released the detonation. On this hypothesis, the shock may have been generated by a first accident on one of the two adjacent workstations (9B1 and 9B2), transmitted to the storage area (9A). However, detailed examination of the concrete floor of these two rooms (9B1 and 9B2) revealed no traces of explosion (no impact, no fragmentation of the concrete or traces of burning). As regards the possible transmission of the explosion from one area to the other, it should be noted with respect to the projectiles recovered and the accounts of witnesses, that at the time of the accident, the door of the storage area may have been left open (though this is prohibited by the safety regulations) and there may have been a handling trolley in vicinity of this door. This trolley might have been pushed towards the storage area by the projectiles generated by a first explosion. Pieces of this trolley were found 150 m from the building in the direction of access door to room 9A.- There may have been an unauthorized detonating product inside the room which caused the bombs to detonate when it caught fire. The product input/output register of building 9 was examined. The register did not show that storage capacity had been exceeded or the presence of any products other than the 50 and 60 mm bombs. Analysis of the debris from the bottom of the crater may allow to identify the composition of the pyrotechnic compound that detonated.Hypotheses concerning the triggering event:The initial ignition source and its location still remain unknown. A first explosion one of the workstations would have left marks on the concrete. An ignition source could have directly generated in the storage area in case of improper handling. However, this second possibility cannot be confirmed by the positions of the bodies of the victims. Yes",

The entire manufacturing section is destroyed or seriously damaged: of the building involved, nothing remains, a crater of 2.5 m x 1 m by 0.5 m deep is visible in the concrete base; a trolley weighing 50 kg was thrown a distance of 200 m, and pieces of wall 50 m. 5 more damaged buildings will have to be pulled down.

        "location_description": "units:  The fire broke out in the pre-heating oven of the hydrodesulphuration (HDS) unit for the gas-oils of the refinery, occupying an area of 5 300 m\u00b2, south-east of the zone devoted to the refinery units. The HDS unit mainly treats the petroleum fractions destined for the production of gas-oils and heating oils. Its function is to reduce the sulphur concentration in intermediate products with the aim of producing combustibles and fuels complying with the specifications for sulphur content defined by environmental legislation.The desulphuration is performed by hydrogenation in presence of a catalyst, the hydrogen being provided by a mixture of gases from the reformer and the steam cracker. The reaction produces hydrogen sulphide (H2S) which is retransformed into sulphur in the unit.The oven involved in the accident:This oven was put into service in 1974 and was used to desulphurate motor diesel, distillates and domestic heating oil.Its technical characteristics are: o Design pressure: 56.9 bar, P o Maximum pressure in use: 42 bar, o Design temperature: 425 C, o Usual temperature in service in the region of 410 C-420 C according to the products for desulphuration.It consists essentially of tubes of 6 inches diameter (DN 150) and elbows in austenitic stainless steel A 312 TP 347 for the tubes and A 312 TP 321 for the elbows, chosen for its resistance to the principal mode of corrosion in this type of oven, which is sulphuration.It is composed of a lower radiation part, in which the vertical tubes are accessible under normal conditions, subject to the action of the flame, and an upper convection part, in which the horizontal tubes, arranged in close, superimposed layers are thus not subject to the action of the flame. Only the bottom layer of the convection tubes is visible, together with the peripheral linking elbows between the layers.In the convection part, the tubes in place were the original ones, while in the radiation part, several replacements of tubes had already been carried out (1 tube replaced in 2001 and 16 tubes replaced at the last stoppage in 2002, before the ten-year test). The reasons given are accidental overheating when restarting in the case of the tube changed in 2001 and zones of overheating due to maladjustment of the burners in 2001 for the 16 tubes.",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  There was a fire in the pre-heating oven of the gas-oil hydrodesulphuration unit for the of the refinery. The accident is classified at level 4 of the accident gravity scale, as officially published in February 1994 by the Comity of Competent Authorities for the implementation of the Seveso Directive (level 3 for the evacuation of 600 persons; level 2 for the quantities of substances released by the accident and level 4 for the resulting costs).The accident:On 26 June 2004 at 16.38, a fire broke out on oven 42F201. Large flames enveloped the oven (the metal of the convection part became red-hot) and gave off black smoke. The fire does not appear to have been preceded by an explosion, but by a suspicious noise, described by witnesses as a whistling noise (as of a valve) growing more and more intense, and then a mechanical noise.Staff working on a neighbouring unit quickly released alarm and had already manually activated part of the water curtains by the time the safety teams intervened. The operator then cut off supplies to the unit (load and hydrogen) and started decompression to the flare, which was successful in rapidly reducing the combustion. The structures supporting the oven and subjected to intense heat flow were cooled.The external fire was brought under control in 30 minutes using the onsite emergency response services of the refinery. The external emergency response services dispatched to the scene did not need to intervene. The combustion of the products from the reactor loop (reactor 42R202) continued at a high level of intensity for several hours in the convection chambers of the oven and the flues at the outlet of the latter.The output of the common chimney collecting the emissions to the atmosphere of the HDS units, atmospheric distillation no. 2 (DA2) and extraction of aromatics (hydrogen treatment section no. 2 - HDT2) was seen to produce flames intermittently for several minutes accompanied by a considerable plume of smoke.None of the detectors of ambient H2S on the unit triggered an alarm. In contrast, it is probable that a certain quantity of H2S was released at the flare.Among the pollutants monitored continuously by the detectors in the neighbourhood of the refinery (air quality measurement network of the Lyon conurbation), sulphur dioxide and in particulates suspension are likely to register peaks in cases of incidents of this nature. The concentrations measured showed no significant increase (they remained below the threshold of information and recommendations for sensitive persons). False False False False",
        "causes_description": "causes:  Inspection plan of the oven:The inspection plan of the oven in force at the time of the accident allows intervals for periodic inspections of 6 years and intervals for periodic requalification of 12 years according to a amendment granted by the DRIRE on 8 November 2001, when setting out regulations applicable to pressurized equipment.With this in view, the inspection department of the refinery drew up the inspection plans of the pressurized equipment of this unit according to the method known as RBI (Risk Based Inspection) in conformity with the professional guidelines of the UFIP (Union Fran\u00e7aise des Industries P\u00e9troli\u00e8res) of February 2000, recognized by the administration by DM-T/P no. 31 538 of 20 October 2000.The application of the RBI method is based on a software program used in the Group, named RBeye, which automates the search for types of deterioration as a function of data relating to the fluid and materials of the equipment, pressures and temperature. The oven has been subjected to periodic inspections from the start, with inspections every three years until 1997, and tests every ten years. The last periodic requalification with testing took place in April 2002, and was successful. It had thus been in service subsequently for 27 months at the time of the fire.The HDS unit was inspected at the time of the general shut-down in 2002 (metal shutdown) and was stopped in 2003 for a simple change of catalyst.The non-destructive tests performed since the start have consisted in measurement of thickness by ultrasound and dimensional inspections to check the absence of creep, all conducted on the radiation part, as the inspection department held that this was the most vulnerable. Since 1993, metallographic replica tests have been carried out on the radiation tubes and showed the beginnings of sensitization of the stainless steel (beginnings of corrosion which could lead to modification of the mechanical characteristics), but this was judged acceptable by the inspection department, in the absence of loss of cohesion or microfissures.On the convection part, only measurements of thickness of the peripheral elbows were made (see photo below), no anomaly being recorded. The inspection report of the periodic requalification performed in 2002 shows that, on the convection part, the visual inspection carried out on the lower layer, according to the inspection department, revealed no anomalies. In this connection, the history of the thickness measurements on the radiation tubes and convection elbows since 1993 shows no abnormal reduction of thickness.For obvious design reasons, it is impossible to inspect the interior of the tubes.The periodic requalification was accompanied by a hydraulic test carried out a pressure of 85.5 bars.Before the fire, the HDS had been operating since the previous day in domestic heating oil mode, a rate of operation considered as moderate. It was fed with a mixture of light distillate from vacuum distillation unit no. 2 and LCO (light gas-oil rich in cyclics) from the catalytic cracker unit. The sulphur content of the load was estimated at 1.16%. It should be noted that before being introduced into oven 42F201, this received an addition of hydrogen contributing to the desulphuration reaction. According to the records, the skin temperature of oven 42F201 was stable in the region of 373 C, the maximum permissible temperature being 392 C (set point).Origin of the fire:The tubes constituting the lower convection layer were found not to have melted, having seemingly been supplied to the end by the load and thus cooled. Among these, one tube found to have burst (a clean break of 500 mm), has since been thought to have been the origin of the fire.Expert examinations performed:Two expert examinations were carried out, one by an external expert, the other by the Group's research centre.Expert examination by the external expert:This was carried out on 2 tubes (the burst tube and a neighbouring tube) on the basis of a geometrical, fractographic and metallurgical analysis of the burst tube and of mechanical tests and analyses by X-ray diffraction.This revealed that the rupture was caused by four types of deterioration, the effects of which had cumulatively led to a reduction of thickness to a point below that at which the tube could withstand operating pressure.These types of deterioration are as follows:- aggression supposedly due to exposure to polythionic acids: these acids form when the sulphurised constituents of the load are in contact with oxygen. This situation cannot occur in normal operation, as the load contains no oxygen. It is encountered during shutdowns or hydraulic tests. To avoid this phenomenon, a passivation operation is performed during the shutdown process (a procedure formalized since 1985). This aggression is thought to be old, as passivation has been performed since 1980. It results in the localized formation of grooves in the inside of the tubes of the oven.- reduction of thickness by oxidation/sulphuration: in the grooves formed by the polythionic acid aggression, the material (austenitic stainless steel) had lost its unoxidizable character, leading to a reduction of thickness by corrosion.- the presence of sigma phase (an intermetallic compound causing very marked fragility of the metal) in a low proportion, which may have facilitated the development and penetration of the intergranular attack.- loss of intergranular cohesion entailing slow creep which, in its turn, generates fissuring in the outer skin of the tubes: this phenomenon could be explained by poor heat exchange, due to a deposit of coke on the inside of the tube. This external deterioration of the tube was not visible to the naked eye.Expert examination by the Group's research centre:This examination conducted on another neighbouring tube revealed none of the characteristic appearance of internal intergranular corrosion found on the burst tube. However, on the outside, loss of cohesion due to creep, and on the inside, the presence of a considerable density of sigma phase were observed. The examination came to the conclusion that there were localized defects.. vessel/container/containment-equipment failure corrosion/fatigue",
        "consequences_description": "consequences:  Injuries - 2 slight injuries Other - 600 evacuated material losses - estimated 28 M Euros (production loss + repair) Human consequences:Two operators were slightly injured during fire extinguishing operations (falls due to irregularities in the paving of the HDS unit hidden in foam).According to the public emergency reponse services, 600 persons were temporarily evacuated from an urban zone of Feyzin (including the swimming pool and the stadium). By way of precaution and in the absence of accurate information from the refinery, the Police Authorities temporarily closed the A7.Material consequences:The detailed assessment of the damage to the pressurized equipment affected by the incident was carried out according to the API 579 method, which consists in determining the temperature levels attained during the fire, the spatial classification of the 6 zones and the definition of a criterion of acceptance or replacement according to the zone concerned. The most significant damage was to the oven:o Total destruction of the convection bundle (melting of the upper convection layers; only the lower layer showed unmelted tubes including a burst tube) (see photo below),o Melting and vitrification of the refractory on the convection part (see photo below), o Overheating of the radiation bundle, o Damage or deformation of elements of walls and roof structure in convection and radiation,o Damage to supporting columns, o Deformation of the bottom section of the flue. The incinerator adjacent to the oven at fault suffered damage to its supporting columns (damage to fire-resistant concrete). According to the operator, this damage is due to aging of the heat insulation. Supporting documentation was requested on this point. Other equipment was damaged by the incident: pipework mainly supplying combustibles and utilities to the oven, electric cables and measurement systems, three water curtain systems on other ovens, certain gas detectors, the loading lines and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the east rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection, the metal ladder of the oven is twisted, the support wall (concrete) of the flue linking the HDS unit to the chimney common to the HDS, DA2 and HDT2 units was damaged, flames were observed for several minutes at the outlet of the chimney common to units HDS, DA2 and HDT2, leading to the supposition of damage to this structure (the refractory in particular).At the monitoring platform for emissions from this chimney, a temperature peak of at least 500 C (the upper limit of detection) was recorded, the remainder of the recording being unusable due to damage to the sensor. Environmental consequences:A description and assessment of the consequences environmental consequences were carried out with respect to: o the nature, quantities, composition and toxicity of the atmospheric emissions (H2S, SO2, dust),o the nature and quantities of the waste and polluted water, and the channels of disposal adopted.The data are given in detail in chapter 2.Economic consequences:The economic consequences are estimated at a total sum of about 28 million Euros, in particular:o 250 000 Euros/day of loss of earnings (the production tool being out of action for 3 months),o 6 million Euros devoted to the repair of the unit, including 2 million Euros for rebuilding the oven as new."

Analysis of the smoke revealed the presence of sulphur derivatives (H2S, CS2, SO2) and HCN.

The slow combustion of chemicals continued under the surveillance of the fire brigade with gaseous fumes being given off over a period of several days.The thousands of tonnes of substances (toxic and highly toxic) involved in the fire resulted in a quantity of dangerous matter being released of more than 5% over the Seveso threshold for toxic (44 %) and highly toxic (495 %) substances.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  Hydrogen peroxide was used in a pharmaceutical industry to deodorize an aqueous chemical effluent containing various strong smelling sulphur compounds. The stainless steel treatment vessel was connected to a cast iron holding receiver by both top and bottom connections. The liquid was transferred by the bottom connection and any foam generated during the treatment vented back to the receiver using the top connection. When the treatment method was first adopted, foam had escaped out of the open man lid in the treatment vessel. The man lid was therefore sealed. The foam then passed up the vent system and contaminated the scrubber system. Hence the modification to vent the foam into the receiver. The treatment method for the effluent was provided by the firm's parent company which was specialized in hydrogen peroxide chemistry. The method used was first to add hydrogen peroxide (35%) and then caustic soda solution (25%) to bring the pH up to approximately 9. On some occasions foaming occurred. Management did not fully investigate these incidents; some of the operators were aware of a pressure rise in the treatment vessel if the caustic solution was added too quickly. On a cold Saturday morning in March an explosion occurred within the plant. The lid of the stainless steel vessel was blown off whilst the cast iron receiver was blown to pieces. A process operator nearby at the time was killed. A fire, producing an acidic smoke, then very rapidly spread through the entire building.Research followed the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed by the sulphur compounds in the effluent. The decomposition reaction is also pH-dependent. At about pH=7.5, a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent, producing a potential explosive mixture.

Each holder had an automatic valve which was operated by a high and low-level trip via pilot gas connections containing poppet valves. During the severe gales in the early hours of October 16, one holder descended from a full position above high knock-off level to a position just below the knock-off level. In descending, the holder failed to operate the high knock-off valve correctly (it is assumed that this was due to wind pressure). During late afternoon of October 21 (five days later) the reducing ambient temperature caused the stock in both holders to fall. At approximately 20:00 the holder descended low enough to operate the change over poppet and the automatic holder valve opened. The ascending holder should have operated the change over poppet again and in the situation which prevailed the holder valve should have closed, but this failed to occur.

During the change-over between tanks, the operator omitted to shut off the bottom outlet valve of the tank now receiving so that when he opened up the bottom outlet valve of the twin tank now supplying the plant he established in error a direct open connection between the twin tanks via the 1 diameter bottom outlet manifold. Owing to the differential tank pressures, propylene oxide from the full tank flowed into the vented tank in addition to current inflow from the delivery tanker.

This has been recently recognised by the Company during assessment for purposes of the CIMAH regulation: the consequent intention was to fit tank high level alarms.2) Staffing and supervision of the plant was inadequate. It had become customary to expect or allow plant operators to keep a check on process plant whilst overseeing tanker deliveries. Any delay on either job meant temporary neglect of the other. In view of the total lack of automatic safeguards continuous operator presence was essential and there should have been a clear rule that there was continuous attendance throughout all propylene oxide delivery and other transfers. This did not happen in practice and the Standard Operating Procedures though fairly detailed were not clear on this point though requiring the plant operator to 'observe the level rise in the receiving tank ... so as not to exceed 80% maximum ...'. Suspension of transfer if the operator has to leave the installation was not laid down.3) Line supervisors were insensitive to the obvious staff shortage on the day of the incident. The out-going supervisor should not have allowed unsupervised delivery to continue during shift change and the oncoming supervisor should likewise have suspended delivery operations or given/arranged adequate support for the lone shift operator. Such decision should not have been left to the operator himself who would feel in danger of criticism for causing delay. organized procedures supervision staffing process analysis design of plant/equipment/system",

Wind conditions were slight and the vapours from the spilling liquid were not dispersed. In early 1986 it was noted that the flare gas recovery system was operating at reduced efficiency. Gas which should have been recovered was being routed instead to flare. Investigation revealed that a 750 mm valve was passing gas when in closed position. A decision was taken to have the valve removed to carry out repairs to it. It was appreciated that there would require to be careful planning to prevent the possibility of leave refinery units being inadvertently isolated from the flare system. One of the flares would have to be taken out of service and therefore the potential flaring demand of the refinery would need to be matched to the remaining two flares. At a number of meetings of operational and maintenance staff, an agreed flare alignment procedure was drawn up outlining flare system conditions necessary for removal of the valve. The earliest time to carry out the work was to be in early 1987 when 2 of the refinery units and flare No 1 were planned to be out of service for routine maintenance. The detailed work methods and safety requirements concerned with the actual removal of the valve were not considered at the meeting. No difficulties were foreseen and the works were organized and arranged by operations department technicians. Few days prior the accident, the valves to isolate live parts of the flare system from the section under maintenance were closed. Immediately prior to work commencing, the BP technician checked the status of isolation valves and he also identify conditions in the isolated section by opening a small valve on the liquid drain line at a distant flare knockout drum. Finding no indication of gas or liquid coming from the valve he assumed that the flare line was isolated, depressurised and free of liquid. Near the work station were located 2 water monitors to disperse residual gas if it should flow out when the valve was removed. Two refinery fire-fighters were present to operate the monitors and to oversee the use of the breathing apparatuses being used by the workers as protection against potentially toxic residual gases in the flare line. Also in the work area there was a crane to lift the heavy valve and a diesel engine compressor to supply air for the breathing apparatuses. Being everything in order, the BP technician issued the permit to the contractor and work commenced. Two fitters and a rigger prepared to remove a flange ring spacer to insert a blank spade in its taken by a crane.

This scale had flaked off from internal surfaces to accumulate at the bottom of the flare pipelines where it turned into a thick viscous-sludge in the presence of vented and condensed hydrocarbon liquids. The sludge had found its way into the guides of flare line wedge gate valves which where thus prevented from closing fully. Sludge had also passed down liquid drain lines at the knock-out drums to cause them to block. Therefore the normal drainage built into the flare system no longer operated and as a result substantial quantities of liquid accumulated. The flare line isolation valves had no means of indicating their fully closed position. It was assumed that exerting considerable force on the handles of valves was sufficient indication. Many of the suppose closed valves were found to be jammed and were still allowing free passages of gas. The pipe to the valve used to test line conditions was also blocked with sludge. Therefore presence of liquids and gases in the line was not identified when the valve was open. Furthermore, the technician judged that residual flammable gases in the flare pipe presented no significant fire hazard. Therefore the system was not purged with inert nitrogen nor steam. In addition, the flare drainage was not verified as being clear of blockages nor the valves as being clear obstruction by the use of injected steam.

High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It overpressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar. The explosion disintegrated the separator and also damaged other vessels and pipes. Released flammable substances were ignited resulting in jet-fires.The hydrocracker unit was commissioned in the early 1970's. The potential for high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP separator was recognized in the design and the flow control valves in the line from the HP separator to the LP separator had provided to automatically close should liquid level in the HP Separator reach a critical pre-determined low point. The safety system was arranged to operate from either of a pair of low level magnetic float switches mounted on a bridle tube attached to the HP Separator. In a safety audit and in a review of pressure relief capacity within the hydrocracker complex which were carried out in 1975, the operator of the refinery concluded that high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP Separator would not arise because there was a safety trip actuated by low liquid levels.As a consequence the pressure relief valve on the LP Separator was sized only for fire engulfment on the vessel and was of comparatively small size. Throughout the 1970's the output of the hydrocracker was limited by a series of operational problems. By the early 1980's these were mostly overcome and throughput started to rise to exceed the design capacity of 23,000 barrels/day. At these high flow rates it was discovered that the liquid in the HP Separator became very turbulent. The rapidly changing liquid levels caused spurious trips of the control valve which in turn caused severe operational difficulties. The low liquid level control valve trip system also lost favour for various other reasons. For example frequent blockages of the pipework leading to the level detectors caused by build up of hard carbon residue and by the solidification of waxy liquids in cold weather. The system was unreliable and therefore was distrusted. Furthermore trips would be over-ridden prior to shut-down so that residual liquid in the HP separator could be emptied. At low throughputs or during standby operation trips would also be over-ridden so that the valves could be opened to allow liquid remaining in the line from the HP separator to be blown clear to prevent accumulation of solidifying wax. As a consequence, in the early 1980's the control valve trip was removed and not replaced. It was left to the operators to detect dangerous low levels and close the valves when they judged it appropriate. Removal of the safety system was authorized at operations supervisor level. Maintenance and instrument engineering managers were aware of the situations and turned a blind eye to it.

The asphalt and residual oils were drained to the plant's surface drain and then to an interceptor pit; any propane present would evaporate. The accumulator vessel had a capacity of approximately 24 tonnes of propane at 50 C and 21 bar.

No dangerous substances were involved and the incident was not a Major Accident as defined in article 1(2)(c) of the Directive. Cable carrying the main 132 kv electricity supply to a large industrial and residential area passed immediately over the site where the fire developped and heat, flames and smoke caused repeated arching between lines carrying separate phases. The power supply became erratic for 30 minutes, was then lost completely for 15 minutes and a restricted supply only was possible during the following 2 days.As part of its article 7(2) inspection duties, the Health and Safety Executive (H.S.E.) decided to carry out an enquiry in each affected installation (submitted to article 5) to establish how they had coped with the loss of power supply. The installations included two major oil refineries. The following potential serious deficiencies were identified:1- Several manufacturers had stated in their Safety Reports that they had alternative source of mains electricity supply to their sites but they had failed to identify that both sources originated from a common supply to the area.2- Major manufacturers such as oil refineries have on-site generation capacity which can also been used to export electricity to the local supply company.

Wind direction = 340  with a speed of ?? m/s.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred in a peak saving station used to store liquefied natural-gas (LNG). The station included a natural gas liquefaction unit, a LNG storage and a LNG compression/vaporization/water bath Thurley vaporizer-facilities. During peak demands, LNG was pumped up to 82 barg to 8 vaporisers from which the gas was injected into the transmission line to 72 barg. As a routine exercise to verify the availability of the site to export gas, the equipment had to be brought to a 1- hour stand-by condition and LNG used to cool down pipes and pumps between the storage tanks and vaporisers. The Thurley vaporiser consisted of a large steel water tank, the water being heated by 6 gas burners. The air supply for the burners was coming from a single local fan via ductwork (up to 24 diameter). The LNG passed through tubes inside the water bath, evaporating and warming up to 20 C. The LNG inlet to the vaporiser was controlled by a motorised hand indicated control (HIC) valve from the control room. An additional emergency shut-down (ESD) valve could be operated locally or remotely. Between these valves there were four drain valves and a relief valve. The drain valves were 0.5 m and 1.5 m above the ground level. The lower level drain valves were the ones normally used.On December 5, an availability exercise was carried out and five of the 8 vaporisers had to be brought to a 1- hour stand-by condition. Two operators were working on A, B and C vaporisers and other two on E and F vaporisers. The shift engineer was present to start-up the LNG pumps and open the main valve. Vaporisers A, B and C were cooled down according to the normal procedure (admission of small amounts of LNG and low level drain valves opened to accelerate the cooling) and vaporisers E and F were being closed when the pumps were started resulting in a jet of LNG from one of the open drain valves. 30 seconds later there was an explosion and fire-ball. Two operators received burns to their hands and face. The fire-ball was approximately 40m x 25 m.

        "causes_description": "causes:  CAUSES:The LNG jet occurred because the drain lines were opened and venting when the pump was started. The operators did not make sure that the valves were closed. The released natural gas was drawn into one of the air intake to a vaporiser burner and was ignited by a pilot flame, flashing back and igniting the gas that was present in the area following the cooling down exercise. Even if it was not known, due to an inadequate process analysis, the cooling down exercise involving the release of LNG from 5 vaporisers resulted in the presence of sufficient gas in the area to cause an explosion when ignited.The process was not adequately analyzed because it was not known that, following the cooling down procedure, in the area there was the presence of sufficient gas to cause an explosion if ignited.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The plant was initially commissioned in 1975 for the manufacture of chlorofluoaniline (CFA) but was also used for manufacturing fluoroaromatic compounds. The whole site contained plants covered by the requirements of Article 5; this specific plant did not however fall under the requirements of Artcile 5. The manufacturer had nevertheless prepared a safety report, which was submitted to the competent Authority at the correct time. This report categorized the process as relatively low risk (the reaction was only mildly exothermic and not very sensitive to small operational variations). The process included the production of difluoronitrobenzene (DFNB) by reacting dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB) with potassium fluoride at a temperature of 165 C and atmospheric pressure. DFNB was purified by centrifuge and distillation and was subsequently hydrogenated to difluoroaniline (DFA), an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry. DCNB and DFNB were identified as substances which could decompose violently at temperatures above 220 C but no circumstances were foreseen which could result in the temperature of the mixture being raised by such a large amount above the normal operating temperature. A few weeks before the accident, the distillation mixture had been contaminated with water through two leaking valves. It was believed that the water had been removed by distillation. During the heating phase the operators realized that the temperature was rising fast, but could do little to control it. The reactor vented, flames were seen to ignite at the top of the reactor and then an explosion occurred, followed by a serious fire. Tank storage of xylene was ignited at an early stage and prolonged the fire.

        "causes_description": "causes:  CAUSES:The accident occurred as the result of a chain of events. The failure of the two valves and the subsequent gross water contamination were the first critical initiating events. There was an attempt to remove the water using a second distillation on the water/toluene intercut. Failure to remove water may have been due to phase separation of water in the base of the main distillation column. The dimethylacetamide (DMAC) solvent was hydrolized to acetic acid. It was known that DMAC does not easily hydrolyse to acetic acid, but fluoroaromatic compounds acted as catalysts (this catalytic property was not previously known) causing an increased acetic acid production. Acetic acid was accumulate in the DMAC because of the similar boiling points. It is worth noting that the accident occurred when the batch loaded into the reactor was the first one to completely use recycled DMAC following its contamination with water. Laboratory investigations have shown that 2-10% w/w acetic acid in DMAC gives a reproducible rapid exothermic reaction at 140-160 C, producing a high yield of higher weight molecular substances with evolution of gas (CO2). This lower temperature exothermic reaction drove the temperature up to that which initiated the violent decomposition of the nitrobenzene compounds. Metallurgical examinations indicated that the vessel failed at about 20-25 bar and 500 C, conditions far above its design pressure and substantially higher than its test pressure. Cooling through both the external jacket and the open vent to a knock-out pot could not cope with the violent decomposition and prevent the pressure build-up in the reactor. process analysis design of plant/equipment/system component/machinery failure/malfunction unexpected reaction/phase-transition",

It was decided that the shut-down would be an opportunity to conduct some repairs and maintenance and also to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that had been recently installed within the regenerator. The catalyst was removed from the base of the generator by a nitrogen assisted steam reduction system until the entry into vessel was possible. The vessel was isolated in preparation (270 blinds had to be inserted before operational procedures allowed entry). The operational procedures that were followed were those that had been successfully used before. Although, it is now realized that they did not take into account the particular set of conditions (that is the large amount of un-regenerated catalyst) in this instance.At approximately 17:30 on Thursday 9, January, fitters started to remove 2 man-way covers on the generator. First a 30 cover was removed to allow a preliminary visible inspection. No gas tests were made prior to opening as the system was considered to be open to atmosphere because of its flue to the stack. However, the removal of a valve and flow nozzle in the flue duct work may have reduced the draw of the flue on the regenerator and, therefore, contributed to an oxygen deficiency in the regenerator. The first cover was removed without mishap and the fitters proceeded to open a second 60 man-way which was just being held by 2 bolts and a block and tackle. One bolt was removed when witnesses heard a rumbling noise from inside the regenerator. This was immediately followed by an orange-red flash came out on the left side of the man-way flange engulfing the group of workers on that side. After a few seconds, witnesses heard a seconf loud explosion. It occurred when the pressure wave from the first explosion reached the waste heat boiler (about 30 metres away) connected to the regenerator by a pipework.

To allow the access into the regenerator, two man-ways were removed and this provided an oxygen entry which produced an explosive mixture with the gases from the contaminated catalyst. The flammable mixture was then ignited and a confined explosion occurred. CAUSES:The initial failure of the blowers was caused by vibration to the blower turbine due to loose objects contacting the turbine blades. It has been assumed that these objects came from the actual engineering materials of the turbine itself.The explosion was probably caused by a mixture of hydrogen, light hydrocarbon gases and carbon monoxide. This mixture was either above its auto-ignition temperature during the oxygen entry (when the man-way covers were removed) or was ignited by pyrophoric carbon deposits. The evolution of these gases was stimulated by the action of steam on the un-regenerated catalyst in an poor oxygen atmosphere (this reaction was discovered in subsequent laboratory experiments). This steam was injected immediately after the crash shut-down in an attempt to regenerate the catalyst and keep the catalyst bed fluid. The opening of the man-ways allowed sufficient oxygen enrichment for an explosive mixture in the previously stagnant internal regenerator atmosphere. This stagnation has thought to have occurred because of the new internal plant configuration which prevented the gases rising and escaping from the top flue and also because of the reduced flue draw caused by the removal of a valve and a nozzle in the ducts between the flue and the stack. management attitude problem organized procedures process analysis design of plant/equipment/system unexpected reaction/phase-transition",

Ground wet due to recent rains. ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:At 02:00 hours an operator detected a smell of benzene in the proximity of pump P-104. On investigating, he detected liquid escaping from a hose attached to a valve on the pump (this valve was found to be half open and was immediately closed). A sizeable quantity of liquid, thought to be a benzene/water mixture, was observed in the pipetrack. Management was alerted. No other people were working in the vicinity of the leak. It was found that the liquid was flowing along the pipetrack to the jetty and the jetty manager was informed by telephone. A considerable quantity of liquid was found to have collected in a sump on the jetty premises (this was part of the jetty pipeline containment system but not intended to collect liquid from the jetty tank farm). There was considerable soil contamination round this jetty tank farm pipeline (this pipeline did not have a proper containment system). On investigating, it was found that plant instrumentation detected and recorded a slow leak from the tank associated with this pipeline between 20:00 hours the previous evening and 02:00 hours. The leak was too slow to show up on the control panel display and was also masked by a ship loading benzene for part of the time. No people were affected by benzene fumes and no ignition occurred. It is estimated that benzene levels in the vicinity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard. An ignition would have had major consequences. False False False False fluid release to ground fluid release to ground",
        "causes_description": "causes:  INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:The leak of benzene involved the pump used to transfer benzene from the storage tank to the nearby jetty. Since the valve on a spare pressure gauge of the pump was not fully closed after a sampling operation, about 19,000 kg of benzene were lost over a period of six hours until the leak was detected.CAUSES:In order to allow the operators to take a quality control sample of the product immediately prior to ship loading, sampling points were provided on the tanks. For the benzene tank, due to security fencing, the access route to the sampling points was circuitous and the operators had got into the practice of taking a sample at the degassing point on the pump. This practice was apparently not known to management (probably including foreman). A hose was left attached to the connection point to facilitate this operation. The practice had been on-going for some months. In this occasion the operator failed to fully close the valve. The pump was bunded, but the length of hose extended beyond the bunding and the end was lying at the pipetrack. No equipment defects or failures were involved in the leak. Underlying cause was failure of management control and supervision, together with inadequate training and failure by operator to follow operating procedures.The accident occurred because of an operator error (code 5401) that failed to fully close the valve installed on the spare pressure gauge connection on a pump. The cap was removed to take a quality control sample of benzene but this procedure was apparently not known to management above foreman level. Underlying causes were therefore the management failure in control and supervision (codes 5301 and 5305), together with an inadequate operator training (codes 5304 and 5303). management organization inadequate organized procedures training/instruction supervision operator error",

The worst possible effects of the cloud would have been mild irritation of eyes and mucous membranes. The operators asserted that an off-site emergency was declared as a precautionary measure (agreed by the emergency services). This involved radio announcements and information given to the local authority and significant retail developments. They also claimed that despite the inconvenience, the public preferred to have been warned of the incident rather than have been left in ignorance with an obvious cloud approaching them. They stated that this attitude was confirmed at subsequent community liaison meetings. Some residents expressed concern to the Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities.The off-loading building was destroyed but no other physical damage sustained to other parts of the establishment. Effects on the establishment were confined to disruption during the incident, when fire figting, subsequent loss of use of the destroyed plant, and management time taken in responding to the community and Competent Authorities. Off-site effects were short-term disruption in response to the major hazard alarm, confinement of members of the public for the duration of the incident, and short-term closure of a nearby motorway.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local"

Reportable due to quantity released: 750000 cubic metres of gas (weight approx 94 tonnes,c. 50% of top tier quantity)At approximately 11.30 am on Monday 9 August 1999 the energy distribution control (EDC) contacted Redcar blast furnace (RBF) control room and reported a dip in gas make from the furnace. No alarms were reported from RBF and the gas make appeared to returnto normal. Shortly afterwards however carbon monoxide alarms went off in the power station (range of CO levels, 40-80 ppm on turbine floor) and it was noticed that the gas make had not returned to its normal level. A check was made of the gas line to determine the source of the gas leak. It was reported that the leak was from the ERT inlet valve and the ERT was tripped. When it came off line the full flow of the blast furnace gas was directed down the clean gas main. In fact the leak was from the demister plate valve, this increased the leak and also, because of the pressure build up in the system caused a pressure sensor situated upstream of the demister plate vAlve to trip at 170mbarg so opening flare stack leg A and allowing the contents of the gas holder to escape to the flare stack. The flare stack was not lit (see below) and the gas was released unflared. Levels of carbon monoxide of 100ppm were recorded around the ramp at no 1 slag pit. At around the time that the ERT was tripped it was noticed that the leak was actually from the demister plate valve and blowing across the top of the ERT building then towards the bag filter house and towards the power station. Part of the cast-house floor of the blast furnace were within the path of the gas. Personnel were evacuated from the cast-house floor of the furnace however casting was in progress and some personnel were required to complete the cast before the plant could be made safe. These personnel were given Draeger comopac carbon monoxide monitors and returned to the casthouse to complete the cast. In the meantime the furnace was taken off blast to reduce the flow of gas. It was reported that the highest levels of gas (200ppm) were found on the rocker bay below the cast house floor. During the release the alarms in the ERT building were set off by carbon monoxide, these are set to go off at 2000ppm. The blast furnace was brought off-blast, an operation which took some time and necessitated the opening of the bleeder valves at the top of the furnace which introduced another release source for the gas during the incident. The u-seal between the blast furnace and the clean gas main was put into place at around 12:20 and the incident declared closed at 13:14 although the blast furnace had not been completely brought off blast at this time. Theexact amount of gas released during the incident is unknown although a British Steel calculation estimates that 130 tonnes were lost through the demister plate valve and 77 tonnes from the gasholder unflared through the flare stack (the gas holder was estimated to be 40% full at the time of the incident). Unusual weather conditions for August, North-easterly wind and heavy rain. Prevailing wind Westerly hence gas cloud moved towards plant instead of off-site. False False False False gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air",
        "causes_description": "causes:  Plate valve used for isolation of gas main during shutdowns and normally kept in open position closed due to electrical short-circuit allowing hydraulic operation of the valve. Valve did not fully close and seal blown off by closing into full gas flow, leak occurred through annulus of valve. System of work in place where hydraulics isolated and locked off when valve in open position had not been followed and electrical fault led to valve closing. Blast furnace shut down but residual pressure in gas holder led to continuation of release, some gas flared but c.750,000 cubic metres lost via valve.The site is a newentrant COMAH top-tier site and little previous work has been done toevaluate the managemnet system in place to prevent and mitigatepotential major accidents. The assessments above are from informationreceived during the investigation into the release. These aspects willbe considered in more detail during inspection as part of theinspection plan. No entry written.The investigation involved two main areas of interest, the demisterplate valve itself and the flare system, these are dealt withseparately below. a) Initial investigations showed that the reason the demister platevalve had shut was because of an electrical short circuit betweenrelays 28767 the local emergency stop and 28777 the local closed pushbutton relay in the demister plate valve location box. This box hadbeen designed to IP65 however a compression joint in one of the topglands had been incorrectly fitted so that part of the steel wirearmouring of the cable was above the level of the seal hence wateringress was possible. This short in itself however should not havebeen sufficient to cause the closure of the plate valve as BritishSteel procedures required physical isolations to be fitted to theelectrical input to the local box together with the electrical andmanual operation of the plate valve clamps situated in the hydraulicshed below the plate valve. None of these three isolations werefitted at the time of the incident. There are a number of procedureson TEMS (Total Engineering Management System) which relate tooperations on the demister plate valve. Of these, Job Safety ProcedureJFP607 refers to operation of the plate valve during shutdowns andincludes details on both closing and opening the valve. The proceduredetails the need to isolate the valve electrical and hydraulic systemsto prevent unauthorised valve operations. The isolations referred toin JFP607 for the valve when in the open position are detailed inisolation no.IF4494,these are; the gas plant isolation valve hydraulichouse below the valve at the north end of the demister); and the gasplant isolation valve electric actuator on the platform adjacent to thegoggle valve actuator in the gas main. When the valve is in the closedposition there is an additional electrical isolation in the switchhouse. The isolations are made by way of isolocks on the localisolators which are secured by an EBI lock. There is a master keywhich fits all EBI locks, this is kept in a key cabinet in the RBFcontrol room and issued via a signing out book. The key to the keycabinet is kept to the side of the communications panel in the controlroom and is easily accessible. The last shutdown which requiredclosing of the demister plate valve was carried out at the end ofJune. There are no records in the key signing out book between 30 Juneand 9 August when, following the release the isolocks and EBI lockswere observed to be lying on the windowsill in the hydraulic housebelow the valve at the north end of the demister. In 1996 and 1997 aquality improvement programme (QIP) was initiated which looked at allaspects of operation of the plate and goggle valves in the clean gasmain. The minutes of the meetings are attached. Issues raised duringthe QIP included the identification of the valves (as problems had beenencountered where personnel meant different valves when that used aparticular number) and safe operation of the valves. Concern wasexpressed about the level of isolation of plate valves as the manualhydraulic override was not isolated. A was raised in which it wasstated that the actuation of a plate valve during furnace operationcould result in a large release of gas and recommended the isolation ofthe manual hydraulic clamp release on the plate valves. Following theplate valve QIP a committee was set up to look at the implications ofCOMAH for the blast furnace. During a meeting on 23rd July 1997 a listof the top ten scenarios for major accidents occurring on RBF werepresented, failed operation of plate valve PIV7 was included on thislist. In addition to the procedures for safe operation of the platevalve, TEMS holds routines for the inspection of plate valves by bothelectrical and mechanical inspectors. There are separate electricaland mechanical routines for all plate valves, some examples areattached. Those for electrical inspections are typically on a two tofour week frequency and include a reference to checking that isolationsare in place. In the case of PIV7 however the reference to check thatthe isolation was in place was added after the incident on 9th Augustso prior to the incident there was no requirement for electricalinspectors to carry out checks that the isolations were in place oneither the electrical junction box adjacent to the demister plate valveor in the hydraulic house despite there being requirements to checkthese isolations on other plate valves. The schedules for mechanicalinspections for the plate valves are similar to those for theelectrical inspections and again there are no instructions on the jobfor PIV7 to check isolations are in place whereas these are present onsome of the job schedules for other plate valves. Two routineelectrical inspections of the plate valve were carried out between theshutdown at the end June and the gas release but TEMS contains nocomments as to the presence or otherwise of the isolations at theseinspections. b) Originally it was thought that the flare had ignited and the gasfrom the gas-holder had been flared, it soon became apparent howeverthat this was not the case and that raw gas was released from the flarestack during the incident. Operation of the flare stack can beinitiated manually or by the tripping of one or more of five pressureswitches situated as shown in the attached diagram. Switches 1 and 2are set to trip at 173mbar and open flare leg A, switch 3 is set at80mbar and opens legs A, switch 4 is set at 85mbar and opens leg B andswitch 5 is set at 95mbar and opens leg C. In addition there is apressure transmitter which ties in with the gas holder level system andacts to open leg C. The flare is not normally lit but lights by meansof an air and propane ignition system when a leg opens. During theincident on 9th August, pressure switch 2 tripped due to a build up ofblast furnace gas around the demister plate valve and so it was leg Awhich opened. At the time of the incident the flare was in an alarmmode and so there was no ignition when the flare was opened. The flarehad been in alarm since at least 1st August (there were no recordsavailable prior to this date but no action had been taken to reset theflare which was done by manually operating a button at the base of theflare stack. Visual display of the alarm is given in the control roomat RBF, when the alarm comes in there is an audible alarm and aflashing light however once accepted the audible is canceled and thelight remains on but does not flash. It is thought that the contentsof the gas holder were lost through the flare in around 7 minutes.During the investigation into the failure of the flare system to igniteduring the incident it was discovered that in fact none of the flarelegs was operable and consideration was given to the service of a COMAHProhibition Notice however action to restore temporary propanesuppllies to the flare legs brought the flare back into use untilrepairs were carried out. organized procedures design of plant/equipment/system user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.) isolation of equipment/system instrument/control/monitoring-device failure",

        "location_description": "units:  The tank involved was tank 713, a 14.1 metre high, 8.5 metre diameter tank, with a capacity of 794 cubic metres. The tank was built in 1977 in accordance with BS2654 from carbon steel to BS4360, Grade 43B. The floor was constructed to British Standard and consisted of lapped steel plates running out under the tank shell. The floor plates were joined to each other with a single fillet weld. The floor is built cone down with a central sump, which permits the tank to be completely emptied between duties. The tank went on hire in 1991 for sodium cyanide, at which time it was given an internal zinc epoxy type lining. The tank was in continuous service until May 1998, at which time it was opened for cleaning and inspection. Inspection was carried out according to the standards set out in the Engineering Equipment Manufacturers Association publication No. 159 - User's guide to the maintenance and inspection of above ground vertical cylindrical storage tanks.The lining was shown to be missing or damaged on the bottom two metres of the shell and across the floor. Loose coating was removed by high pressure water jetting. Floor and shell plates appeared sound with no pitting or other corrosion apparent. Plate thickness was tested using ultrasonic techniques and no thinning of the plates was apparent. The tank was returned to service in July 1998 but a routine stock reconciliation in August of that year showed a discrepancy of some 23 tonnes. The tank was again emptied and inspected. A pin hole leak was found in one floor plate weld, believed to be due to the loosening during the recent tank washing of a slag inclusion from the original construction of the tank. A detailed visual inspection of all other floor welds was carried out and in total 23 sections of weld were ground back and re-welded with a double pass fillet weld. The repaired welds were tested using dye penetrant techniques and the floor was subjected to testing using under floor low pressure nitrogen and hydrostatic techniques. No problems were detected. the tank was returned to service in September 1998.",

Reportable as the incident involved the accidental loss of more than 5% of the qualifying amount laid down in the COMAH regulations.At approximately 15.30 hours on Wednesday 21 July 1999, a maintenance supervisor noticed wetness around the berm of tank 713. It was concluded that sodium cyanide was leaking from tank 713. At 16.50, following checks for suitability and cleanliness, the transfer of the tank contents to tank 402 commenced. A pump was also set up to collect product pooling in the bunded area. The atmosphere surrounding the tank was checked for cyanide vapour. None was detectable at any height above 5cm from the wet bunded area floor.Meteorolgical conditions at the time of the incident were not significant, except in so much as the leak was detected initially by a visual sighting by an operator of the leak against an otherwise dry tank berm.

The branch hadinadequate support and was vulnerable to vibration fatigue. Processhydrocarbons at approx 14 bar pressure and 240 degrees C. Flash point&lt;0 degrees C.Source of Accident - Remarks:The Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) situated on the Oil Refinery had been shutdown on 29th May 2000 following a power distribution failure. On 10th June 2000 at approximately 03:20 a.m. during start up procedures which commenced on 9th June there was a significant leak of hydrocarbons from the FCCU creating a vapour cloud which ignited resulting in a serious fire. The cause of the leak was subsequently found to be the fracture of an unsupported 6 x 3 reducing tee branch pipe to the main transfer line due to fatigue failure. Between spring 1998 and June 2000 there was an increased number of start ups and shut downs on the Vapour Recovery Unit.Further, a number of incidents had occurred during the two years prior to this incident in which vibration was a relevant issue - for details see the HSE report at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/incident/page14/.htm#EffectsFollowing the last major revamp project in 1998 the FCCU had been experiencing considerable difficulties and had not been able to operate consistently. This was due to a combination of technical problems with the front end catalyst handling section and other issues such as loss of utility supplies (steam, power etc.). This had resulted in the plant being subjected to numerous start-ups and shutdowns over the intervening two-year period and especially during the few months preceding the fire. In the 11 weeks preceding the incident, 19 start-up attempts had been made, of which 7 reached the stage of starting to bring the Vapour Recovery Unit on line.FCCU start-ups are periods of intense activity for the operators whilst the plant is brought up to the steady-state design and normal operating conditions from ambient and hydrocarbons are gradually introduced into the system. This requires significant manual involvement to open/close valves as necessary on the plant as well as assistance from the control room operators monitoring the plant from the plant distributed control system (DCS).Starting up a process unit results in significant changes (operating temperature and pressure etc.) on the pipework and vessels as they are brought up to the required operating conditions from ambient. Increasing the frequency of start-ups results in fluctuations in conditions and increased cyclic stresses on mechanical systems as a result of these. Under such cyclic conditions the pipework can become fatigued with defects developing that can subsequently lead to failure. general pipework/flanges general pipework/flanges Yes",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  Loss of containment of approximately 11.5 tonnes of flammable hydrocarbons at elevated temperature, following the failure of a 3 branch on transfer line between fractionation columns, on fluidised catalytic cracker unit recovery section. The release ignited and the subsequent fire caused extensive damage to the plant. No serious injuries. Discussion about the occurrence:On the evening of the 9th June the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was in the process of being restarted. The front end (see Figure A) i.e. the cracking section was started up successfully by about midnight. The intention was to then start the back end Vapour Recovery Unit (VRU or light ends section) (see Figure B) of the plant by progressively introducing hydrocarbons into each of the columns in turn.The main fractionator and absorber columns were successfully brought on line and then material was introduced into the Debutaniser column (E5) sometime after 01.00 a.m.At this stage the control room operator had difficulty in achieving the correct temperature and pressure at the base of the column E5 and this resulted in the relief valves lifting. Problems were also experienced in maintaining the correct levels in the next column downstream (the Re-run column E6) due to gas being present in the pump which controlled the liquid levels in the column. This was a common problem experienced during start up conditions.During start-up and before transferring liquids from E5 to E6, standard operating practice for plant operators is to dewater the transfer line using a number of drain points on the system. Dewatering is essential because if the water in E5 (which is operated at a high temperature and pressure relative to the conditions in the column E6) was transferred into E6 it would result in the water immediately flashing off to produce steam. The transition between liquid and vapour phases is accompanied by significant volumetric changes and this could potentially damage the Re-run column E6.In order to dewater the column a drain point at the base of the column E5 on the outlet pipework is opened and water is allowed to escape to the local ground drains until hydrocarbons are observed coming out. This operation is carried out several times prior to transfer commencing in order to ensure that all the water has been removed. The hydrocarbons discharged to the drain system are subsequently removed in the effluent treatment systems for the Complex and are not discharged off-site.Following the dewatering procedure the transfer of liquid from the base of column E5 to column E6 was initiated by the control room operator at about 03.15 a.m. This was achieved by opening a flow control valve in a 6 transfer line between the two columns.At approximately 03.19 a.m. operators working on the plant in the vicinity of the Debutaniser column reported a leak of hydrocarbons (described as a white vapour smelling of spirit) coming from the base of E5 and drifting northwards towards the hot oil pumphouse. The control room operator was notified of the leak and immediately stopped the feed to the unit.At approximately 03.23 a.m. whilst the plant operators were investigating the source of the leak and beginning to isolate valves, the release ignited and the operators ran quickly to a place of safety. A serious fire developed at the base of E5 and this then had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The fire was automatically detected by a fire detector located in the Hot Oil pump house facing the debutaniser column E5, which alerted the Control Room.The control room operator isolated the feeds to the light ends system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If however the wind had been in a different direction towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Branch failed at welded joint to main transfer line. The branch had inadequate support and was vulnerable to vibration fatigue and/or shock loading. Old plant, circa 1950's vintage. Change made to configuration of branch pre-1987. Poor change control. Pipework inspected for corrosion only. No proactive surveys for dead legs/redundant drains.The primary immediate cause of this incident was the fracture of an unsupported 6x3 reducing tee branch pipe to the main transfer line between the Debutaniser column (E5) and the Re-run column (E6) of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) (see Figure B) due to fatigue failure. This resulted in the release of highly flammable liquid/vapour at elevated temperature and pressure, which subsequently ignited(probably on an unprotected hot flange nearby).There were serious operational problems associated with the FCCU stage two modifications in 1997/98 which were a relevant underlying cause of this major accident. These were inadequately dealt with by BP despite recommendations in writing from the HSE to review the process after a torch oil explosion late in 1999.BP reviewed the FCCU earlier in 2000, partly to try to determine why it was not operating properly (eventually traced to a blocked cyclone dip leg) and to compare it with BP FCCU world standards. The review findings were not implemented or communicated properly.The CIMAH FluidisedCatalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) installation safety report 1997/98revision claims and concludes that - hardware and software controls inplace on the FCCU are adequate to prevent the occurrence of a majoraccident which could affect the general public, the personnel workingon-site or the environment around it. Based on investigation findings,this was partly unjustified even in 1997 when it was submitted, andcertainly did not reflect the reality by 10th June 2000 when thecumulative effects of unreliability, numerous plant start-ups,vibration and unsupported pipework factors came together. The safetyreport was not proactively used as a management standard for reviewingcontinued safe operation, nor used as an audit tool to verify theclaims made for safe operation. There were serious deficiencies in theCOMAH compliance regime and the safety report did not reflect thereality of the plant operations and maintenance. management organization inadequate maintenance/repair corrosion/fatigue",

Area concerned - Remarks: There was substantial damage to high-level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed (see Photographs 1 -6).The contaminated firewater containing hydrocarbons from the plant was generated in excess of the capacity of the stormwater retention facilities on-site, and this resulted in the release of untreated firewater direct to the River Forth.Smoke and combustion products were also generated as a result of the fire. However, subsequent analysis of the surrounding environment, both on and off-site, showed no sign of significant levels of contamination as a result of the incident.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater. There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.The Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) has several very small radioactive sources which are used for non-intrusive level measurement in the catalyst section.

However, subsequent analysis of the surrounding environment both on and off-site showed no sign of significant levels of contamination as a result of the incident. Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater. There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area.Overall the investigation concluded that no significant environmental consequences were identified.Community Disruption:Although this incident did not directly affect the local population, it did cause significant local concern, as it was the third in a series of incidents which occurred at the site in a very short period of time.Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000 (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition, the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the Complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.Discussion of the Consequences:The fire developed on the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) at the base of E5 and had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If, however, the wind had been in a different direction, towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred, the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the light ends section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged, either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts, and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater. There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns following the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/impact.htm.Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed."

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  A fire occurred in a corner of the waste station at a lower tier COMAH site used for the treatment and storage of chemical waste. The fire rapidly spread to the rest of the transfer station, resulting in the violent rupture of numerous 205 litre drums and small aerosols. There were no on-site casualties. Some off-site ill-health symptoms have been reported, but there is currently no conclusive evidence of long-term impairment of the health of any members of the public.The incident was compounded by serious flooding in the area causing the site to be cut-off four days after the incident, and accessible only by boat. The majority of the site itself was flooded to varying depths.The incident is reportable as it meets the following criteria:a) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(a) - a fire involving a quantity of at least 5% of the qualifying quantity (for top-tier application of very toxics), andb) COMAH schedule 7, Part 1, para 1(b)(v) - evacuation of persons/time being greater then 500 hours. On the day, 60 people were evacuated for 12 hours. Further evacuations occurred the next week due to concern about possible on-going side effects.Type of accident - Remarks: A fire occurred at approximately 02.00 on Monday 30 October 2000 in a waste storage area at Cleansing Service Group Ltd (CSG), Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst, Gloucester. The site is a licensed waste treatment facility and transfer station for a wide range of hazardous waste chemical substances and is notified as a Control of Major Accident Hazard Regulations 1999 (COMAH) Lower Tier site. The fire originated in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site which was unoccupied at the time, rapidly spreading to other areas of the site. The incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day. The Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site. The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder. The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: Details above from Met Office via Gloucester Fire Service.Severe weather warning issued by the Met Office at 04:07 Monday 30th October 2000 (affecting Gloucestershire): severe south westerly gales with damaging gusts to around 80mph and outbreaks of heavy rain will gradually clear eastwards during the morning. The strong winds are significant as this is the possible cause of drum falling and initiating the incident. Also significant in spread and severity of fire.Precipitation: rain; Wind speed: 216.00; Wind direction: SSW; Wind stability: D; Temperature: 12.00Chronology of incident:- On Monday 30 October 2000 at approximately 02.00, a fire occurred in compound 1 of the waste transfer station in the southwest of the site (unoccupied at the time).- First call to the emergency services was logged at 02.19 and the Fire Service arrived on the scene within 6 minutes.- Agency staff attended immediately. HSE and other parties, including Gloucestershire Health Authority (GHA), also attended during the incident.- The Fire Service was unable to approach the site for some hours because of the intensity of the fire and small aerosol cans exploding.- The incident occurred at a time of severe storms with gale force winds and very heavy rain. Wind speeds peaked at 50 - 60 mph. These extreme weather conditions continued to cause problems throughout the day.- The Fire Service set-up a forward command post in the car park of the Globe public house, located on Sandhurst Lane approximately 1km south of the site. At approximately 10.40, this site was evacuated due to the expected flooding of Sandhurst Lane. The command post was re-established at the southern end of the lane, approximately 2 km from the site.- The Fire Service accessed the site via the fields to the south, due to the very strong prevailing wind from the south. Throughout the day, water and foam were applied to the fire which was concentrated at the south end of the site.- The fire was eventually fully extinguished by 18.00 on the 30 October, having burned for approximately 16 hours, although a number of drums involved in the fire continued to smoulder.- The fire was restricted to the waste transfer area and did not affect the bulk tank storage on site. Most of the firewater was retained on site, by site containment measures, but some contaminated water escaped and had to be pumped back.- The Fire Service remained in attendance overnight. They relinquished control of the site early the next morning, the 31 October, allowing access on to the site for HSE and the Agency to begin investigation of the incident.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Main failings identified by the investigation:1) Failure to have an adequate system for the reception of waste onto the site in that containers of waste were not categorised according to a suitable hazard classification system. The classification according to hazard forms an essential part of a safe system for allocating appropriate storage locations.2) Failure to have an adequate system for the safe storage of different classes of hazardous materials. This system would have included, in addition to the hazard classification discussed above, the following elements which the site failed to implement:\u00b7a) an up to date plan of the storage areas showing appropriate locations for the different hazard categories. This would include suitable segregation/separation distances between the different hazard categories marked on the plan and would be derived from the risk assessmentb) an adequate segregation and separation policy as part of clear, easy to follow procedures to ensure that the findings of the risk assessment were implemented. These procedures should be linked to the procedures for pre-booking waste to be delivered to the site to ensure that designated storage areas, as marked on the site plan, are not exceededc) adequate instruction and supervision arrangements to ensure that the procedures and arrangements shown on the storage plan are implemented in practiced) adequate arrangements for ensuring that laboratory smalls are separated into drums according to hazard category and that these drums are then stored appropriately according to that hazard (ie not all drums of lab smalls stored in the same place irrespective of hazard)e) adequate arrangements for the exclusion of all ignition sources from areas where flammable liquids are stored, including the installation of suitable electrical equipment which will not introduce an ignition risk.3) Failure to carry out a suitable risk assessment into the hazards and risks associated with the storage of dangerous substances in containers. The failings included:\u00b7a) no consideration of specific substances or generic categories of hazardb) inadequate consideration of storage arrangementsc) inadequate consideration of control measures to prevent any incident except for reliance on employees' intervention to prevent escalation of any incidentd) no consideration or comparison of applicable guidancee) no specific consideration of laboratory smallsf) segregation was not considered as a safeguard or preventive measure for the prevention of fireg) assessment focuses on the personal safety of individual employees and does not adequately consider the risks of accidents that may cause harm to groups of persons or to persons outside the site boundary, or the risks to the environment. management organization inadequate management attitude problem organized procedures training/instruction supervision process analysis design of plant/equipment/system user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.) testing/inspecting/recording vessel/container/containment-equipment failure Yes",
        "consequences_description": "consequences:  Injuries - Emergency Personnel : 13 material losses - approx 5 million euros, see above nearby residences, hotels - Evacuated: 1 - Disabled: 0 - Destroyed: 0 The Site Operator has estimated that the cost of the incident has been approx 5 million euros, of which 1.4 million are insured and 3.6 million uninsured. This includes both direct costs from the incident (site restoration, loss of business etc) and other costs as a result of findings from the investigation (including the disposal of radioactive materials found on the site and the investigation of unauthorised disposal of waste at the site).In addition to the costs above there are the fines and costs from the Court cases described below and the charges made under COMAH by HSE (of approximately 120,000 euros). This gives a figure of approximately 7 million euros. Also as a direct consequence of the incident the site never returned to operation and has now permanently closed.There were no on-site injuries or ill-health. Nine people were taken to hospital for examination on the day of the incident (believed to be 4 fire service personnel, one policeman, and four local residents) but none were detained in hospital. Subsequently numerous reports of illnesses to local residents have been reported. Direct linking of these reports to the incident is unclear and is being investigated by the local health authority. None of the 17,500 tests carried out on over 500 environmental samples indicated any significant levels of contaminants off-site, although contaminated firewater run-offs is believed to have killed several hundred worms. The Environment Agency is continuing its' investigation into the long-term environmental effects. Environmental MonitoringA plume of smoke from the fire was driven by the high prevailing wind in a north, north-easterly direction over the village of Sandhurst. No samples from the plume were obtained. Modelling work on the contents and the fate of the plume was commissioned as part of the legal investigation. The findings of this work are to be used with the human health study. The Environment Agency and contractors undertook sampling of soil, water and air in and around the site. This was targeted as much as possible to identify whether residents and their properties had been exposed to significant levels of harmful substances from the fire and the subsequent flooding events. Evidence of contamination on site and where firefighting run off water had collected was found. There was no evidence, from the media tested, to indicate that there had been widespread contamination off site at levels hazardous to health or the environment. Results of property monitoring were provided to residents and all results are available from the Environment Agency.Soil samples obtained in June 2001 showed no selenium or arsenic above the detection limit and contamination was restricted to elevated levels of phytotoxic metals (Lead Nickel and Copper) within the fire fighting wash water zone immediately adjacent to the site. All other results were at background levels.A macro invertebrate survey of the Horn's ditch (which is adjacent to the site) in July 2001 revealed biological quality had marginally improved from a previous survey undertaken in 1996.The Horn's ditch was also electro-fished in July 2001 and found roach and eels to be present. There is no historic data available for this stretch; however the results are what would be expected for such a watercourse.A survey of teasels (a form of thistle) was undertaken in the locality. This indicated an atmospheric discharge of selenium did take place during the incident in an area close to the CSG site.Subsequent sampling of nearby pylons and new growth teasels, both proved negative for selenium.In summary, the results of these surveys do not indicate any significant long term contamination and discussions will be undertaken with FSA, Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs and NFU to decide if further monitoring is appropriate.A precautionary pollution warning was issued to Severn Trent and Bristol Water but there was never considered to be a risk to drinking water abstraction as the Severn Trent abstraction is upstream of the incident. The flooding was preventing abstraction from the river Severn from taking place at the time of the incident and hence Bristol Water was also unaffected.Community Disruption:The fire resulted in the Police evacuating approximately 60 local people at the time, who were allowed to return to their homes that evening, the 30 October. The evacuation itself was hampered by the fumes from the fire. 13 people sought medical advice (mostly emergency service personnel but including some local residents) although none required admission to hospital.There was significant off-site concern, with the formation of a local pressure group, campaigning primarily to stop the site re-opening; this was successful as the site did close down following the incident.Media interest was also significant, in both local press (print &amp; TV) and national (print &amp; TV).There was much interest from the Local Member of Parliament with questions raised in Parliament and consequent interest by Ministers (a number of reports were prepared for the Deputy Prime Minister - details see C4c below)."

Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. Valving was changed manually. The pump operation was semi-automatic, having three settings for offloading (South mode), transfers (North mode, and recirculation (Auto mode). The pump setting control was in the plant control room.Setting the pump mode for offloading (South mode) enabled the larger tank alarm and disabled that on the smaller tank. Setting the pump for transfer to the smaller tank (North mode) switched the enabling of the weight alarms and enabled limit switches on the larger tank outlet and the tanker offloading valves which prevented pump operation when these valves were open. Setting the pump for transfer to the process plant (Auto mode) disabled both high weight alarms and the limit switches on the 40 tonne tank outlet and tanker valves. This was supposed to allow the recirculation of phenol between the ring main and the smaller tank.Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund.

As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.The operator wrongly positioned valving which set the system up to take phenol from the larger storage tank, circulate it to the manufacturing plant and back into the smaller tank. The outlet of the latter had been closed hence it gradually filled up and passed out of the overflow into the bund.Had the pump mode been correctly selected for transferring to the manufacturing plant, the limt switch on the larger storage tank outlet valve would have been enabled and would have prevented the transfer pump operating, but the pump mode was incorrectly set, by-passing this interlock.Since level measurement relied on load cells, the panel operators' understanding of plant status was flawed. Just prior to the incident phenol had been transferred from the larger storage tank to the smaller (from which the manufacturing plant was supplied). The high weight alarm had been used to judge when sufficient phenol had been transferred and the alarm had been acknowledged. Not enough phenol had been used up by the manufacturing process for the weight in the smaller tank to drop and hence for the alarm to reset. Thus as the smaller tank was filling up the panel operators did not notice it.The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.

",
        "location_description": "units:  The blast furnace was a conventional column-supported furnace of a type in use worldwide. It consisted of a large (circa 90 metre) vessel supported on heavy steel columns. It was constructed in two sections, the top half having limited vertical movement on a lap joint with the bottom half. The furnace had a 3.5 cm thick outer shell and a refractory lining in which were inserted approximately 1,400 copper coolers. Water was pumped through the coolers to remove heat.It was capable of containing approximately 2,000 tonnes of burden (iron ore, coke and limestone) and had 24 tuyeres (nozzles) located at the base just above the hearth. Typically this process involves hot air being blasted into the bottom of the furnace through the tuyeres (capable of delivering 180 cubic metres of hot blast per hour), leading to the production of several thousand tonnes of iron per day. The oxygen in the air combusts with the coke to form carbon monoxide and generates a lot of heat. The carbon monoxide flows up through the blast furnace and removes the oxygen from the iron ores on their way down, thereby leaving iron. The heat within the furnace melts the iron and the resulting liquid is tapped (removed) at regular intervals by opening a hole in the bottom of the furnace and allowing it to flow out. For more details, See the full report on the incident- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  A blast furnace explodedat approximately 17.13 hours on 8 November 2001. The accident event began with a rapid over-pressurisation of the furnace contents in the bosh area due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials. The immediate effect of this furnace over-pressure was to lift that part of the structure above the lap joint upwards, the furnace lintel rising up off the column heads normally supporting the furnace. It is estimated that the structure above the lap joint rose by some 0.75 m. This structure, with its associated burden, was estimated to weigh around 5000 tonnes. The lifting of the upper part of the furnace left an opening of approximately 400-600 mm around the entire circumference at lap joint level. Gases and hot materials were ejected horizontally from this opening. During the period that this gap remained open, some 200 tonnes of liquid, solid, and semi-solid material were ejected onto the cast house floor. Gaseous material and dust rose into the cast house, exited through various openings in the building and into the atmosphere, where much of it ignited. A cloud of ignited dust and gaseous material was thrown several hundred feet into the air above the furnace. The furnace-top \u2018bleeder\u2019 valves also opened and discharged into the atmosphere. Gases from these valves also ignited.The furnace then fell back down vertically as the pressure decreased. During the explosion it had twisted (anticlockwise) through approximately 20\u201350 mm and moved a distance off-centre of about 100 mm, leaving it supported on the lower lap joint plate, with the lintel mounting positions no longer in contact with the column top flanges but instead some 50\u2013100 mm above the column tops. This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by \u2018rumbles\u2019 within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the \u2018jump desk\u2019 (control room).For more details, See the full report on the incident- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf False False False False conflagration (a general engulfment fire) rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state)",
        "causes_description": "causes:  Theblastfurnace exploded due to significant internal overpressure brought about by the interaction of water and molten hot materials within the lower part of the furnace.The explosion occurred after a prolonged attempt - over two days - to recover the furnace from a chilled hearth situation caused by cooling water ingress. The immediate cause was the mixing of water and hot materials within the lower part of the furnace; the precise mechanism remains a matter that is not fully understood.The water had entered the furnace from its cooling system following a chain of events initiated by the failure of safety critical water cooling systems. At the time of the explosion, attempts were continuing to recify the abnormal operating conditions that this had created and to recover the furnace.The precursors to the explosion were a combination of significant failures in health and safety management extending over many years. These failures were not confined solely to the blast furnace plant; they extended elsewhere within the company, and in particular to the Energy Department which supported essential cooling water for the furnace.A failure to carry out suitable risk assessments for blast furnace operations resulted in the failure to implement robust technical and procedural controls. There was insufficient redundancy and security of cooling water supplies, and overall cooling system reliability showed a downward and deteriorating trend over several months.For more details, See the full report on the incident- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf management organization inadequate unexpected reaction/phase-transition",

Their injuries included burns of varying severity,lung damage from the inhalation of hot gases and dust, and serious fractures.Several individuals had very serious burns and multiple injuries of a life-threatening nature. The injuries arose from blast effects, with burns from hot water and steam and the hot gases and dust ejected. Many more suffered minor injuries and shock, and a number of personnel present were subsequentlydiagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Damage was generally limited to the confines of the blast furnace area. The lifting of the furnace body caused considerable disruption to all its services and associated plant. The furnace structure immediately after the accident was no longer supported directly upon its structural columns and was therefore in a potentially unstable condition.Hot materials comprising molten slag, molten iron, partially reacted coke, sinter and unreacted coke, together with larger lumps of agglomerated burden material, had been ejected through the open lap jointdamaging the blast wall immediately behind the west side of the furnace. Subsequently, furnace burden penetrated into the water manifold/launder area and into the hydraulic room destroying the water manifold and damaging the wall of the hydraulic room beyond. Penetration of molten burden through a doorway into the amenities block initiated a significant fire which caused serious damage.The profiled steel cladding of the building was severely damaged in several areas, with some sheets being projected in excess of 40 m. Molten slag was thrown over most of the cast house floor and flowed as far as the entrance ramp to an estimated depth of between 300 and 600 mm. There was no penetration of solid material into the control room, although there was impact damage to its front.Areas where gas plant structures had moved significantly were identified after the accident, but gas containment was maintained and there was no major blast furnace gas leakage from the downstream gas system. Significant amounts of flame and gas were, however, emitted through the furnace top bleeders.Subsequent engineering evaluation byengineering personnel deemed the furnace to be beyond repair and itwas demolished and rebuilt to a more modern design \u2013 one which does not feature a lap joint.Although disruption to the community was relatively minor, with local traffic being affected on the night and local government facilities used as information centres for employees and their relatives, the exposion caused widespread alarm and concern throughout the locality.There was no damage to the environment.The company was subsequently prosecuted under sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and was fined \u00a31.33 million, with \u00a31.74 million costs also being awarded."

The failure occurred downstream of, and in close proximity to, a water injection point that was not part of the original design.Examination of the failed elbow of the pipework showed that it had failed due to an 'erosion/corrosion' damage mechanism which, over time, had reduced the wall thickness at the outside of the elbow to such an extent that the wall could no longer withstand the internal pressure within the pipe. The wall thickness had been reduced from around 7-8mm to a minimum of 0.3mm. When the pipe failed, it burst open catastrophically,causing a 'full-bore' type of release of the pipe's contents.Metallurgical examination of the pipe revealed that the uncorroded sections of the pipe were internally coated with black iron slphide, known as the 'passivation' layer which, once formed, serves to protect the carbon steel material from further corrosion. However, when the water injection was in operation it washed away the protective coating leaving it open to attack by corrosive agents in the gas stream.

        "causes_description": "causes:  A work request was raised to replace a leaking pump for a bulk storage tank containing para-Toluidine (PT) on Monday 22 July 2002. The steam was turned off and the single automated isolation valve to the pump was closed.On 25 July work began to replace the pump. The line was broken to remove the pump. The maintenance technician then went to collect a new part from the stores leaving the work site unattended. No additional isolation was provided.Whilst the technician was away from the work site molten PT began to flow from the pipe over filling the spill bund and spreading across the site. It appears that the valve had failed or was not closed. In addition, the PT had not solidified as anticipated - it is likely that this was due to the head of available liquid in the storage tank and the high ambient temperature on the day of the incident.There are 2 principle causes for this incident. Firstly, the single automated isolation valve was open at the time of the release although it appears that it had been closed before the work began. At present, the nature of this failure is not clear. The clean up exercise continues and an assessment of the valve will be made when access is available.Secondly, the level of isolation provided was inadequate. The design of the plant means that there is only one automatic valve between the storage tank and the pump. Reliance was placed on the single closed valve and the nature of the product i.e. that its melting point is 44 C.A tank containing 30 tonnes of molten para-toluidine at 55 degrees C(melting point 44 degrees C) had a faulty pump connected to the bottomrun-off line. A fitter removed the main body of the pump for repair.For physical isolation of the pump housing, the fitter relied on asingle valve and a frozen plug of para-toluidine behind the valve, asthe steam had been removed from the tracing to this line, to seal thecontents. Shortly after the fitter left, the tank contents werereleased due to the failure of this isolation. The para-toluidineoverflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, contaminating awide area with a solid layer of toxic material.

It is now thought that the line contained scale from previous operations and this scale became wet as a result of the hydrotest. The drying procedures rely on any water in the system being driven to low points by the circulation of hydrocarbons, where the water is collected and subsequently drained. However this relies on flow through the plant and linework. Since the failed line was on the discharge of a pressure relief valve (PRV), there would be no flow. It is therefore suspected that the line was still wet when taken back into service.The presence of this water, together with the 0.3% Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) in the Isobutane (iC4) process stream, is thought to have caused the accelerated corrosion and scaling. design of plant/equipment/system corrosion/fatigue",

The failure occurred because the agitator suffered some damage, which caused the agitator shaft to distort, applying stress on the flange, loosening the studs, and allowing the flange to lift and the vapour to escape.The release was detected by a flammable vapour detector sited close to the agitator, which alarmed in the control room. Operators went out onto site to investigate and could see that a cloud of cyclohexane vapour was filling a proportion of the plant structure and was also drifting off the installation, although vapours were not seen to travel beyond the site boundary.The operators initiated the Emergency Response Procedure. The release was tackled by:(1) attending the site of the incident and setting up water sprays to cool and knock down the vapour cloud; and(2) initiating a shut down and depressurisation of the system to restrict the quantity released. vessel/container/containment-equipment failure",

Once at decomposition temperature, the chemical, which is an oxidiser, is self-reactive and generates heat. The polypropylene tube would have been heated until it started to deform and melt, mixing plastic with the oxidiser, leading to flaming combustion of the plastic.

Crude oil was therefore able to flow into the feed line through a non-return valve. Recognising that the line had no thermal expansion relief, the company implemented an ad-hoc system to manually drain oil trapped between the block valve and non-return valve using a high pressure alarm as a prompt to drain off oil. However, with no block valve at the feed end of the pipework, crude oil was able to continue to flow towards the production end each time a quantity of oil was drained off, causing pressure to repeatedly build in the line and requiring frequent draining operations. This system of work was not risk assessed or proceduralised.On 7th May 2008, the informal system of work was not communicated to the day shift technicians. Therefore, when the high pressure alarm and then high high pressure alarm sounded at 09:14 and 09:20 respectively, the panel technician failed to appreciate their significance and no action was taken to drain oil from the line. At 13:33 a 12 inch flange gasket ruptured on the line due to over-pressurisation from thermal expansion.

The convex base welded to a heat-insulated, high-pressure water vapour pipe connected to catalytic reforming equipment had burst prior to ignition. The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty. The water vapour, circulated at 520 C under 120 bar of pressure in the pipeline, tore apart the asbestos cement cladding on the wall located 20 m from the original rupture and escaped into the atmosphere with a load accompanying noise. The two employees present in the unit at the time cut off vapour supply to stop the sound, shut down production operations and cooled the steam reformer with nitrogen.

        "causes_description": "causes:  A metallurgical assessment of the base indicated that slow creep had initiated on the outer skin, which combined with flow into the material layer was the cause of pipe rupture. This hypothesis relied on the detection of oxidised, yet non-deformed, pipe openings in the presence of intergranular microcracks on both the pipe and its base. The origin of this creep was explained by the metallurgical composition of the base, i.e. ordinary carbon steel containing no alloys and not adapted to temperatures above 425 C. The pipeline was made of a slightly-alloyed P22 type steel, which was more resistant to creep and compliant with the original specifications defined 32 years prior for both material elements. Inspections carried out at the time on the convex base did not detect any noncompliance of the steel, given that non-destructive technology had not yet come of age. This creep might have been accelerated as a result of heat treatment performed at 700 C during equipment installation, once the assembly had been welded. Periodic inspections dedicated to pressurised equipment on the damaged pipe were only recorded into the log 25 years after service start-up, at the time of applying for facility recertification. The initial recertification was rendered official without any underlying structural documentation (misplaced), and subsequent inspections never focused on the section of pipe that would burst.Nine months before the accident, the in-house inspection team had requested adding the mode of degradation by high-pressure vapour pipe vibrations to the unit's pipe inspection routine, following a break in the drain valve of a high-pressure pipe when restarting operations at the unit. On the day of the accident, this mode had not been included in the inspection programme. Classified Facilities inspectors requested a materials control of all unit pipes before restarting operations; this additional step revealed 12 other noncompliant steel components (a tee junction, tap, base, flange, etc.).",

Wind speed = 2m/sec (data given by the company).The accident occurred between 11:40 and 11:50 a.m. at the upper level of the building at the pesticide plant, in the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials. The pre-heating at 40\u00f650oC of the contents of the barrels was carried out by means of hot water, which in turn was directly heated by steam supplied by a steam coil (the coil diameter was 5 cm whilst the diameter of the holes of the coil was 0.5 cm). According to the standard operating procedures, the operator had to be always present in the installation and to control the temperature of the raw material. The temperature control had to be carried out by checking the water temperature by means of a hand thermometer and by switching-off the steam valve. The heating of the water was allowed for a period of 2\u00f62.5 hours as maximum, since long operating experience had shown that this period of time was sufficient to reach a raw material temperature of about 40oC. The day of the accident dimethoate (14 barrels each containing 124 Kg of material) and parathion-methyl (6 barrels each containing 260 Kg of material) had to be heated. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve of the line heating up the water of the bath. Thus, the heating time of the water of the bath and the barrels was extended for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels containing dimethoate. As a result of the explosion (probably due to the friction between the caps and the bodies of the barrels), a fire of dimethoate occurred with subsequent emission of NOx, SOx and mercaptans. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps in other six barrels containing dimethoate. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water (because its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plsnt was not adequate), the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone. It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the wastewater treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea. The plant halted working on 16 of January and started again to work on March of the same year, after the replacement of the water-bath by a new one.It is under juridical investigation if the water used to extinguish the fire was totally treated in the waste water treatment plant and in the pool made out of gypsum and limestone or if it was partly released to the sea.

The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps of other six barrels containing dimethoate. CAUSES:When the Original Report was prepared, the accident was under juridical investigation. At that moment, the current analysis of causes was the following:According to the process specification and to the standard operating procedures, the pre-heating of the dimethoate was carried out in the water-bath at 40 - 50 degrees Celsius with a residence time of 2 - 2.5 hours. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the valve of the steam heating up the water of the bath, thus extending residence / heating time for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels.Further uninvestigation revealed that:Despite of the standard operating instructions for the pre-heating of dimethoate, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve (codes 5303 and 5401) heating up the water of the bath and the overpressure, due to the vapours produced in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels (code 5102).

For that reason and/or because of developing of toxic products of combustion 17 residents were evacuated.For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litre of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted.Chronology of the event:A former, drug-addict employee of the company crawled into the warehouse on rest-day, and after inhalation of thinner vapours became stuporous, lighted a cigarette. After this fire started, which in short time spread to the whole warehouse.The person captured in the warehouse ran to the grid and shouted for help. The porter being in further distance ran to the site to check what happened. As he saw the warehouse in fire and the person within shaking the grid, ran for the key. After coming back he tried to unlock the door, but because of high heat-load he could not approach the building.The cans, drums were exploding continuously, endangering the near-by residential houses and the firemen arrived for extinguishing the fire. Because of the huge heat-load 36 fire-engine and 143 firemen were fighting against the fire in turns, for more than 9 hours. For fire-fighting there were used 33000 litres of extinguisher-foaming material, 5000 kg of extinguisher powder and 3.5 million litre of water. The large volume fire-extinguishing water moved via the channelling toward the Danube. It was managed to close at water treatment station on time, thanks to quick action the access of extinguishing water into the living water was prevented, the river was not polluted. One person - the causer of fire - died in fire, 10 firemen suffered injuries.The fire started between 08.40-08.50 on Saturday 26th June 1988 in the paint-store of warehouse. The detection of fire was enabled by smoke, flames and silent popping voice coming from the building (08.53). The fire-station was informed by reception via direct fire-alarm telephone. The plant staff (3 porters, 1 electrician) did not tried to extinguish the fire. The alarm-notices from the residential people arrived from 08.54, in which huge smoke and five floor high flame was mentioned.At 08.58 - based on exploration - the whole warehouse was in fire, the fire endangered the open-air storage place near to the warehouse. Despite of quick action the spread of fire to cans could not be prevented, the plastic cans placed on pallets melted and the linseed oil stored in them fired floated as lava, causing direct danger of life of gusher-leaders and danger to fire-engines. The liquid in fire on the yard endangered two near-by buildings (paint-stores), the spread of fire to these buildings could have caused incalculable consequences. Because of quick spread of fire the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm-level at 09.06. At 09.08 the attempt for rescue of person captured by the warehouse, the room locked with grid was in fire, the man did not show sign of life. It was managed to force back the liquid in fire between the two stores (09.12), the fire could not spread further. A part of liquid in fire flew to the lower level underlying building site behind the warehouse, inflaming the tool hut standing on that area and/or endangering four pressure-bottle fixed to the hut. The fire-fighting leader ordered protection and evacuation of bottles, but two of them exploded.The fire-fighting was done continuously by powder-, foam- and water-gusher. It was not managed to form monolithic foam-covering neither with operating foam-gusher and foam-guns together, because the liquid in fire was proved strong antifoam agent, furthermore the storage mode of materials made more difficult of forming the foam-covering (on pallets, above each other). After recognition of antifoam agent the fire-fighting leader ordered the supplementation of foam-forming compound, what would have been justified to be done earlier.The heavy smoke threatened some of the near-by residential houses, therefore action was taken to evacuate 17 person - mainly elder aged people.By 10.10 with involving other emergency units, and/or operating the powder-gusher discontinuously it was managed to stop the fire of liquid on the yard, there were no reinflame. The fire could be controlled inside the building. Meanwhile the foam-forming compound was off, the fire-fighting and cooling continued with water. The sump gullys were occluded by balled fat, the water could not drain. The liquid from the cans exploded spread on the surface of water in seconds, and compassed the gusher leaders, this way suffering burn injuries. At 10.16 arrived the foam-forming compound, the fire-fighting with foam continued. By 10.39 the fire was 90 %, by 10.45 totally extinguished. At 10.45 some heated box under the pallets exploded and the liquid spread reignited the fire, the fire-fighting continued. The flash of liquid spread on surface of water caused injuries again at 10.56.Because of serial reinflames and explosions inside and in the environment of the building the total extinguishing of the fire could not be achieved, but controlling the fire-sources the fire did not spread to larger area. The fire-fighting leader ordered the notice of Water-treatment Company, i. e. huge volume of extinguishing water polluted with high quantity chemicals will arrive to water treatment plant, they were asked to do the actions needed and/or to clean the occluded sump gullys at site. Thanks to the notice on time the responsible persons separated the polluted water, this way no polluted extinguishing water entered the Danube.At 11.25 the mortal remains of victim was found.It was not managed to prevent the evaporation of inflammable liquid spread, causing continuous reinflame, for solving this fireman captain leader of Operative Unit of Department of the Interior's Fire-fighting National Headquarter, proposed forming of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering, which was a key tactical solution in view of fire-fighting. The foam-covering was formed by AKG-800 foam-maker and with EVAM foam-forming compound. The equipment was used up to now only in oil industry for consolidation of extinguishing of large-surfaced fire, evolved in salvager. The fire and smoke-production stopped in 10 minutes after the equipment arrived at site and operated, producing total foam-covering on the site affected. The produced foam-covering was stable also on morning of next day, there was no need for complementation. The total extinguishing of fire was effected on the whole site and in the building after introducing the foam-covering (22.08).

On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide plug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was emitted into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident.The oxidation reactor was located in a process room dedicated to the synthesis of 2-chloropyridine with 70% hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide. The reaction was recognized to be exothermic. It was controlled by the rate of addition of the peroxide to a well stirred mixture of the catalyst in pyridine compound. The required peroxide for each batch was transferred from bulk storage to an intermediate holding tank. This tank was located on the ground floor process area and the peroxide was pumped into the reactor via a flow meter. The pyridine was pumped into the reactor from 200 litres drums. The catalyst was added from 50 kg bags through the man-hole. The safety features for this exothermic reaction included: circulation of the reactor contents through two heat exchangers during oxidation; a 200 cm pressure relief line to atmosphere with a 0.7 bar bursting disc; a water quench tank located 3 metres above the reactor, which would automatically dump its contents into the reactor should a sudden temperature increase (&gt; 3 C) occur. The peroxide addition pump would not operate if: the quench tank was not full; the circulation pump was not operating; the reactor's vent was not open to the atmopshere. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide slug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly and resulted in a runaway reaction. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was released into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident. The investigations carried out by the company after the accident showed that approximately 115 Kg of peroxide were added to the reactor over a 3 minutes period instead of the normal 4.5 kg/minute. The subsequent company investigations found valves 4 and 5 closed on the peroxide transfer line and valves 1, 2 and 3 opened just after the accident. For the above accelerated rate of peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 must have been opened. It is thought that an operator failed to close the valves 4 and 5 and opened valves 1, 2 and 3 following the operating instructions. Just after the explosion, he must have realised his mistake and reset the valves in accordance with the correct instructions before the accident investigations.

Besides, the process analysis and the design plant were not adequate.The explosion was caused by a runaway reaction (code 5106) that occurred because of an addition rate of hydrogen peroxide higher than that expected.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  After the due consideration of the contradictions, the probable scenario of the accident can be summed up as follows:On the territory of the organic substances establishment of BV Rt in the storage farm for inorganic substances, hydrogen fluoride tank no. 3 (hereinafter HF3) had to be prepared for the inspection by the boiler inspector. The first phase of the preparation is the purging of the empty tank through an adsorption system, while being heated by means of an external pipe bundle. This phase was carried out from 27/09/2005 to 30/09/2005 in the morning. On September 30, 2005 one of the the shifts has started the morning shift. The shift leader assigned his workers to different jobs and establishments at the start of the shift. The plant manager starting to work at 7.30 a.m., after getting preliminary information, instructed shift leader to carry out the mechanical works at storage tank HF3 as a task of priority.Discussing the manpower need for this job, plant manager told to shut down the mono-nitrating plant and after finishing-off the ongoing charge, also the shutdown of fluorination plant no. 2 and he was of opinion that the manpower released in this way would be sufficient for the execution of the task. Shift leader, after the decision made by the plant manager, had the mono-nitrating plant shut down. He first sent the workers from there to the foreman to pick up tools and special protective equipment and then the workers had to contact plant manager for further assignments. Shift leader did not clearly interpret the instructions he received from the plant manager with regard to the operation of fluorination plant no.2, because he has dismissed one of the operators from there and sent him to help with the mechanical works and he did not give clear instructions to the other operator to start a new charge or to stop the operation either. The preparations of the mechanical works related to tank HF3 came to an end at about 8 o'clock. Mechanical works started under the on-site supervision and management of plant manager. Neither the plant manager, nor the workers actually involved in the works deemed it necessary to wear special protective equipment. Simultaneously with the mechanical works the actual process steps of the charge introduced in the night shift at the fluorination plant were going on. Upon the completion of those steps the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 has started to feed a new charge with HF feed, as he interpreted the instructions given by the plant manager that the plant did not need to be shut down, he was only instructed to pay more attention during the handling of the HF-valves.At about 9.00 o'clock a.m 3 works from the team carrying out the mechanical works have started to relocate a pipeline section (about 6 m long) dismantled earlier. The later victim held one end of this pipeline section in his hands. During lifting he was at the free nozzle that was connected to the HF measurement off-gas pipeline of the 2nd fluorination plant. Probably the operator of the fluorination plant no. 2 has finished the feed of HF from the measuring drum and has started the depressurization of the space inside of the drum by that time.Gases saturated with HF released trough the free nozzle have contacted the face and the upper body of the later victim. After recognizing the accident his colleagues have immediately escorted the injured to the emergency shower close to the scene, where they have showered his upper body and then at the first-aid point on the 1st floor they washed off the injured body part with Ca-lactate solution. Then they have transported the worker to the ordination room of the company doctor by forklift truck. The call center operator, on the basis of the information received from the shift leader, informed the paramedics at 9.05 who transported the injured at 9.30 from the territory of BV Rt. into the hospital. The plant manager being close to the scene when recognizing the accident has blocked the open off-gas valve of the HF measuring drum at fluorination plant no. 2. With this movement the release of gases saturated with HF through the free pipe nozzle into the atmosphere was terminated. Note: at a distance of about 0.5 m from the pipe end, in the same off-gas pipeline, there is a shut-off valve that was, on the basis of the information received from the plant manager in the course of the on-site inspection, not blocked in the moment when the accident happened and it was the plant manager who has blocked it after the accident.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Summary of deficiencies:1. There was no individual procedure regulation the preparation of the HF-tank for the authority inspection.Reasons: on the basis of the previous regulations the authority shall inspect the tank every 3 years, according to the new regulations every 5 years in case of this tank. This covers individual mechanical and cleaning works that were executed always under the technical supervision of the plant manager. Though it is specified in the Procedure for the production of raw BTF on the fluorination production line no.1 and 2, art. 3.3.2.2 that for the purposes of maintenance, repair the equipment, pipelines shall be opened only using the relevant protective equipment specified for the individual substances, this protective equipment is listed in detail in art. 3.8.2 for each substance. 2. The workers received training for the individual job concerned in verbal form, the completion of this training is not documented. 3. Requiring the people involved in the mechanical works to use the special protective equipment. The plant manager did not require before the start of the work and even after recognizing smaller abnormalities to use special protective equipment. The plant manager informed the workers on the work and on the related dangers. After being informed they did not think it was necessary to use special protective clothing and in case there was no such protective clothing, they did not refuse to work. Though it is specified in the Procedure for the production of raw BTF on the fluorination production line no.1 and 2, art. 3.3.2.2 that for the purposes of maintenance, repair the equipment, pipelines shall be opened only using the relevant protective equipment specified for the individual substances, this protective equipment is listed in detail in art. 3.8.2 for each material. The collective and individual protective equipment to be made available in case of individual works are listed in the procedure MVSZ-04 as well. 4. The transmission of information for the job was not clearThe shift leader interpreted the instructions of the plant manager improperly, and he was mistaken, as at fluorination plant no. 2 the plant manager instructed to shut down the plant after the charge feed in the night shift would be finished. The mistaken interpretation was due to the fact that the shift leader understood that he would only have to provide manpower for the mechanical works and therefore he sent only one of the operators to the mechanical works. He assigned the other operator to the further operation and he did not describe the assignment in detail. The operator at the fluorination plant no. 2 understood from the instructions of the shift leader that he would not only have to finish the ongoing charge, but he could start feeding a new charge as well. /At that time the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 was only a kind of supervision, therefore, for this activity, even one person would have been sufficient. However, for the feeding of a new charge, in case of the operation of one plant, two persons shall be assigned according to the work instructions./5. At fluorination plant no.2 there was only one person carrying out the feed of the new charge, though the operator should have known on the basis of the work instructions that in case of the operation of a plant 2 people shall be assigned to this activity. 6.

The hydrogenation was carriedout by bubbling hydrogen into a well stirred mixture of theintermediate in acetone, the solvent, with a palladium catalyst at 35degrees Celsius. The hydrogen was fed into the reactor through a 1 cmdiameter pipeline from a cylinder bank of hydrogen stored outside atground floor level.The Company carried out a wide range of chemical syntheses, producing finished bulk pharmaceuticals for different customers. All the processes were carried out in one common production building. The main process area included 12 process reactors ranging in size from 1,000 to 8,000 litres. These reactors were usually assigned to a particular synthesis but could be used for other processes if the chemicals used were compatible with them. Reactors 2 and 6 were dedicated to hydrogenation reactions. The reactor manlids were approached from the first floor level while the underside of the reactors were approached from the ground floor level. A pilot plant, two quality control laboratories, one research laboratory, two mill rooms and an office led on to the first floor process area. Operator's locker rooms and services were located on the mezzanine floor below the quality control laboratories. Reactor 6 which was involved in the accident was used to carry out the hydrogenation of a pharmaceutical intermediate, carried out by bubbling hydrogen into a well stirred mixture of the intermediate in acetone, the solvent, with a palladium catalyst at 35oC. The hydrogen was fed into the reactor through a 1cm pipe from a cylinder bank stored at ground floor level.The operation of the plant was organized in two shifts. Since the hydrogenation at Reactor 6 would have taken at least 30 hours, it was not possible to complete the reaction during a single shift. The reaction was commenced at 08:00 a.m. on the day of the accident and, at 11:50 p.m., the shift chemical operator closed down the system as follows: he shut off the hydrogen addition at the reactor and closed the valve at the hydrogen cylinder bank; the reactor's agitator was turned off and the reactor was left isolated with an hydrogen atmosphere over the liquid. No nitrogen inerting was used. The operator checked the reactor's control panel which showed normal operating temperature and pressure. The operator was also in control of Reactor 5 which he shut down in a similar manner. At approximately midnight, as the chemical operators were changing in their locker room, they heard a loud explosion coming from the process area. As they evacuated the building, they observed a fire around the Reactor 6. The area sprinkler system was automatically activated and quenched the fire. It was noticed that one operator was missing. He came to the assembly point a few minutes later and said that, when the explosion occurred, he was trapped in the mill room weighing finished product. He could not exit by the process area and had to exit through a hatch on the floor, jump onto a rotary dryer below and climb down to the ground floor. A second explosion occurred a few minutes later. A fire with a characteristics black smoke resulted, indicative of a solvent fire. The sprinkler system extinguished the fire. The building was left vacant for the rest of the night. An analysis of the Reactor 6 contents showed that approximately 400 litres of the total contents (about 1200 litres) remained inside the vessel. A quality control analysis of this material showed that the reaction was progressing satisfactorily before the accident.

About 60 kg of hydrogen contained in the gas initially released formed an unconfined vapour cloud and exploded. The explosion was audible up to 2.5 km from the factory and it caused considerable alarm to the residents. Lengths of pipe on either sides of the rupture were displaced as a result of the depressurization. An 8 m length pipe downstream rotated upon itself of about 380  while a 12 m length pipe upstream rotated of about 90 . This 12 m section damaged the pipes on an adjacent pipe-rack rupturing the vent header from the desulphurizer unit and causing the release of approximately 600 kg of methane. The hydrogen released from the upstream section of the 24 pipe subsequently burned as a jet-fire about 70 m long. The released methane initially burned as a cloud (60 m long) and then as a jet-fire from the ruptured vent header. On hearing the explosion and by the indications from the plant instrumentation of a major leak, the plant operator shut-off the supply of natural gas to the plant and shut-down the individual units.

The ruptured pipe caused further damages resulting in release and ignition of methane and in the release of a small amount of ammonia that dispersed harmlessly.CAUSES:Metallurgical examination of the 24 pipe showed that a fatigue failure occurred, induced by thermal cycling. Examination of the fracture faces of the ruptured seam weld showed a significant amount of fatigue cracking initiating at the bore of the pipe along a length of about 3 metres of the weld downstream the water injection point. At the upstream end, the rupture propagated circumferentially around the pipe as a shear failure. At the other end, the rupture arrested at a circumferential weld and then propagated as a circumferential tear in the pipe material. The spray pattern from the nozzle was such that water at 80 C was intermittently hitting the inner surface of the pipe and quickly cooling the surface. The process gas stream at a temperature of 230 C quickly heated up the pipe wall again only for it to be quickly cooled by water impingement at the start of the next cycle. This phenomenon which affected a number of areas in the pipe wall downstream of the water injection nozzle caused a number of small fatigue cracks which ultimately developed so that the material near the longitudinal weld failed. Subsequent examination of the spray nozzle showed that this may have been distorted for some time prior to the accident causing preferential impingement possibly enhancing the failure mechanism although it is not concluded that this distortion was the main cause of the failure. There was a two year history of previous leaks in welds further downstream on this section of pipe which it is now recognized were due to the same cause. At the time the company wrongly diagnosed the cause as external stress corrosion cracking.The accident occurred due to the rupture of a 24 pipe (code 5102) caused by a cyclic fatigue corrosion (code 5104). The cyclic fatigue corrosion was induced by thermal cycling. The underlying causes that led to the corrosion of the pipe were: a plant design inadequate (code 5308), insufficient maintenance procedures (code 5313) and an inadequate management attitude problem (5302) because it failed to clarify the causes of previous accidents. management attitude problem design of plant/equipment/system maintenance/repair component/machinery failure/malfunction corrosion/fatigue",

Some people engaged in fighting the fire were sent to hospital as a precautionary measure. All were released from hospital the following day. The reason for so few injuries was that the relevant building was partitioned into two areas and all personnel in the building were in the area least affected by the major accident.ECOLOGICAL HARM:Harbour waters and foreshore were contaminated by the fire water run-off. Levels of solvent found in inshore pools and water were below the levels likely to give rise to acute toxicity. Biological inspection of the shore adjacent to the establishment did not provide any evidence of damage to invertebrate organisms. The dispersion of toxic cloud is shown on two photos attached to the Original Report.MATERIAL LOSS:The material losses, including the business interruption, has been estimated at about 27M Euros. The cost of off-site losses has not been determined.COMMUNITY DISRUPTION:Water distribution to the community was interrupted for 24 hours. The emergency services did not consider it appropriate to evacuate any person outside the establishment. The effects of the fire and explosions were reduced in overallimpact due to the location of the factory and the layout of the site.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: localConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of: Ecological component: marine or fresh water habitat - Affected Yes"

The subsequent explosion and fire frightened the population. Sulphur dioxide was released by fire only for a initial (short) period of time. After this period, only carbon dioxide was released. On-site arrived a group of experts for a technical survey. They established that: - there was no immediate danger for the population to justify the immediate evacuation of the area because the released gases were immediately burned by the various small fires still existing;- to maintain the 3 controlled fires on the existing openings of the plant and create a safety zone with a water curtain for cooling the nearby plants and tanks. In this way the escaping gases were completely burned thus avoiding the risk of creating an explosive mixture and the presence of asphyxiating gases;- it was decided to left open the steam column existing in the lowest part of the storage tanks area, to cool the metallic supports of the tanks;- not convenient to restore neither the railway nor the highway nearby, due to the existing risk of fire in the tanks yard and in the cracking columns. This because it was not possible to exclude that a collapse of the column splitter Ethylene (80 m high) could involve the adjacent cracking columns, still full of highly flammable substances;- it was decided by ICAM, and approved by the experts, to set up a flare connected with the various points of the plant for burning the propylene coming from the refrigerating plant, and the other substances already in the plant, thus accelerating the exhaustion of the fire on the base of the cracking columns.

Also, there was a risk of burned products flowing into the Sperone channel (with consequent damages to the activities in the harbour) and serious risks to the public health.

        "location_description": "units:  In the storage plant there were atmospheric tanks of two kinds:a) tanks No 42 and 43, with a parallelepipedal shape, slightly less incapacity than the others and made in steel plate with reinforcing ribson every side with the roof held up by metal trusses;b) tanks No 44 and 45 (with a volumetric capacity of 3,000 m3 and anoperating useful capacity of 2,700 m3 each) that were built morerecently, with a carrying structure in reinforced concrete andinternally lined to improve their tightness with steel sheeting. Bothroof and supporting pillars were also in reinforced concrete lined withsteel sheet.All tanks were covered by an earth layer (about 1m thick) and equippedon the roof with vents and man-holes. Tank No 42 contained, in threeseparate sections, nonane, hexane and xylene. Tank No 43 had previouslycontained methanol but, when the accident occurred, was practicallyempty and had to be decontaminated to receive subsequently nonane.Tanks No 44 and 45 were filled with pure methanol.The whole number of workers of the depot was 84, operating in two or,exceptionally, three shifts. When the accident occurred, in the depotwere operating 15 people. container; non-pressurised (hopper, tank, drum, bag, etc.)",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:Taking also into account witnesses who heard a first big explosion and a few seconds later two other more suffocated explosions, it was deduced that most likely the empty tank No 43 exploded first causing the explosions of tanks No 44 and 45. The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection. Probably the explosion was caused by the ignition of a mixture of residual methanol vapours with air formed during the degassing operations of tank No 43 (it was degassed with air in order to recover nonane). When the explosion occurred, five workers were working on degassing operations: after the accident, three dead bodies had been recovered and another worker was missed (his lifeless body was found a few days later). On the basis of the positions in which their bodies were found, they were presumably on top of the tank No 43, near to an open man-hole. The last worker, heavily injured, had been found in the pump-room and was hospitalized. According to Carmagnani's officials the tank's cleaning was considered a routine operation: depending on the substances to remove, water or air were used for cleaning purposes. In case of purging with water, washing water gathered by a draining system was conveyed to a waste-water treatment plant. In case that two incompatible substances had to be loaded subsequently into the same tank, purging with air was used (air was pumped in the vessel through a man-hole and was discharged from other openings). This situation occurred for tank No 43 because methanol residues were considered incompatible with nonane that had to be stored. All purging operations were normally carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the surrounding environment for the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks). The first aid room was equipped with stretches and medical supplies and fire extinguishers were placed as laid down under the Fire Brigade's Regulations.

It seems that, by mistake, the operator connected the road tanker to the wrong tank, i.e. he emptied the nitric acid into a tank containing formic acid.

Few minutes later the fire brigade intervened (using personal breathing apparatuses and protective clothing), diluted the liquid acid on the ground with water and created a containment to prevent the acid spreading over on the ground. Nebulized water was also used to dilute the nitrogen oxides vapours. In the meantime the evolution of the cloud (directed towards the sea) was continuously observed from a helicopter. Personnel on the helicopter relieved that the cloud was rapidly dispersing in about 100 metres from the source of release.

When the accident occurred, the valve FV-1 was positioned on AUTO and the autoclaves were opened and empty. A flow meter set-point was wrongly positioned to the maximum sensitivity and it could have caused, for a not clear reason, the opening of the valve with emission of water in the scrubber tower.

Initially, a strong whistle from this tank had been noticed but it was supposed to be a steam leak. Repair of the steam duct had been organized. The operators sent on the top of the tank for the repair works noticed a cloud with a yellow-green colour escaping from the tank and gave the alarm. A large fire developped and a strong explosion occurred 6 or 7 minutes after the whistle was noticed. Combustion products of cyclohexanone and dimethoate together with the toxic substances from the insulating and plastic materials of the nearby pipings, structures and plants involved in the fire were released into the environment. Due to the explosion, the front bottom part of the tank was thrown towards the Rogor plant and the remaining part, as a missile, against the reinforced concrete wall of the control room about 45 m away. The fire that followed the explosion had been extinguished by water-sprays in about 20 minutes with the intervention of the plant firemen and the National Fire Brigade. Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps), a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the sea. Prohibition of bathing followed. The degree of pollution of the air, soil and water due to the release of toxic substances and combustion products as well as the fire extinguishing water were continuously controlled (the results of these checks are shown in a document attached to the Original Report).

Ignition of cyclohexanone vapours due to the exothermic reactions might have caused the following fire and the explosion.2- operational error that could have caused the overpressurization or tank failure (leakage) resulting in the release of Rogor and cyclohexanone. Ignition of cyclohexanone vapours due to unknown causes may have caused the following fire and the explosion.Both cases resulted in tank failure (code 5101) and liquid release. vessel/container/containment-equipment failure unexpected reaction/phase-transition operator error",

This solution was enriched with ammonium carbonate coming from the ammonia treatment unit. The pH of the solution was manually controlled once per shift and adjusted if necessary by adding sulphuric acid solution so that the pH was maintained within the slightly acidic range (5 to 6). The solution's pH was periodically checked (every 8 hours) by an operator. When the accident occurred, the operator realized too late that the ammonium sulphate and ammonium carbonate solution was became basic and suddenly added a 60% sulphuric acid solution to it. This resulted in an abnormal production of carbon dioxide that overpressurized the tank which exploded because of inadequate pressure relieving capacity (the hydraulic trap with which the tank was equipped was not sufficient to withstand the peak pressure generated). The collapse of the tank caused the release of the solution (about 20 m3), which was partially recovered in the containment basin of the 2 glass lined tanks and partially in the yard. The rest of the solution was collected, through the sewer network, in the emergency basin of ACNA. All plants (except power plant and the oleum production plant) were shut-down in order to reduce the amount of effluents to the sewer network. This allowed the depuration of the ammonia solution released from the exploded tank and accumulated in the emergency basin avoiding, therefore, the pollution of the Bormida river.

The water pressure broke two Teflon membranes having the function to separate the ATC from the water of firefighting system.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  The accident occurred when a workman of the company was unloading propane from a road-tank (~35 m3) to the fixed plant via a flexible tube. For reasons not yet clear, a considerable release of gas into the atmosphere occurred. A vapour cloud was consequently generated, which invaded the plant. Being not able to stop the release, the man gave the alarm following the procedures, to the firemen, the national railway (whose tracks run close to the establishment) etc. After the arrival of the firemen, just when initiating their action, a first explosion took place, followed by a fire. The fire involved the two firemen teams, the truck-vessel driver and the employee who had given the alarm. The truck vessel was cracked in the above side (a hole of about 500 mm) with release of a big amount of propane and formation of a little fireball. The fire's heat-radiation caused the explosion of a nearby truck-vessel containing only few litres of LPG. A fragment of this vessel (1500 mm long) was found at a distance of 500 m, after it had provoked the crash down of the roof of a room close to a one-family house. Other fragments were spread around at minor distances. The fire, besides destroying the two motor-pumps of the fire-fighting team, affected 2 other truck vessels containing 12 and 35 m3 of propane and an empty truck vessel (12 m3) and 2 railway-vessels of propane (70 m3 capacity) waiting for unloading.The accident originated at 7.30 on 15 march 1996, when an employee of the company was transferring liquid propane from a truck-vessel (35 m3), standing there from the evening before, to the fixed storage installation. For causes not yet identified by the authority of Treviso, a big leak of propane occurred with the consequent formation of a flammable cloud about 1,5 m high. At 7.40, being impossible to stop the leakage, the employee gave the alarm by a multiple automatic device, foreseen by the emergency plan and calling directly the firemen of Treviso. About 10 minutes later, two motor vehicles of the firemen arrived into the establishment taking position between the office building and the bottling platform, where it was assumed that the propane cloud had arrived that moment. In such position the two motor-vehicles were at 35m from the truck-vessel which had caused the release. While starting the action to disperse the cloud, for not yet established causes, a first explosion occurred and a fire spread up to the truck-vessel, which was source of the release. The fire which involved all the vessels and truck-vessels standing nearby and only partially one of the 12 storage tanks forming the fixed installation, was put under control by the intervention of other fire brigades. at about 16.00 o'clock the same day. The population evacuation in a radius of 400 m from the establishment has been protracted, precautionally, up to the morning of the following day. As far as it concerns the crack formation (500 mm large) on the top of the tanker which had released, it should have occurred 10-15 minutes after the fire broke out, while the explosion of the half-empty tanker (12 m3) occurred at about 9 hrs). This last caused the complete destruction of the metallic vessel, which divided into fragments of various size; the fragment retrieved at greater distance from the origin is the same which demolished the roof of a room annexed to a private uni-familiar residence 500 m far from the establishment and sited in the residential area of the town causing only material damages.

A stainless steel rodder enters the converter (by means of a stuffing box) & passes diagonally down into the connecting pipe work, through which it enters the reactor. The rodder (by means of forward, reverse & rotational motion) is used on a periodic basis to clear any product blockages that might otherwise form in the connecting pipe work. The rodder, which is replaced every two years, was originally designed to be one-piece & manually operated, but at some stage this was changed to two-pieces (i.e. 0.7m & 3.0m), screwed & welded together, & pneumatically powered. The plant was in normal operating conditions when, during a routine rodding sequence, as the rodder withdrew from the converter, the shorter piece of it pulled clear of the stuffing box leaving a 3cm orifice through which the dangerous substances escaped, auto-ignited & reacted to form a cloud of phosphoric acid & combustion products. The longer piece of the rodder fell back into the vessels, blocking the isolation valve in the pipe work between the converter & reactor. The phosphorus feed was switched off & emergency cooling applied to the converter. The flame at the orifice continued for ~129 minutes i.e. until the piece of rodder that had pulled clear of the stuffing box was re-inserted into the orifice.

At that time an explosion occurred with practically immediate consequences on materials and persons involved. The help request has been made by a radio mobile team of the Carabinieri (police) from the barracks Camisano ; immediately after they heard a strong explosion they arrived on the place. Following the call by the police the firemen of Crema arrived within appr. 15 minutes on place, later also the firemen of Cremona. The personnel of the establishment received first aid. At that time, the personnel consisted of 7 persons, not present were the director general and 2 people from the administrative personnel. The director general declared at the on-spot-investigation that there were no written procedures for the distillation since the process was not considered to be so complicate. This process was of discontinuous load type (batch process). Besides the fixed installations in the factory there were various plastic drums having a volume of 1 m3 each whose content was not verifiable because they had no labels. For these items the director general of the company declared that they were used for intermediate or final storage of the distilled. For the same purpose, a mobile vessel of about 6 m3 capacity was used. False False False False runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic) runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic)",

Initially a break of the tube of a serpentinecontaining products to be processed occurred, which evolved into a holeof some cm diameter in the zone of maximum opening of the flame in oneof the 2 burners. The product escaping from the hole supplied thecombustion which, being poor in air, was incomplete causing theobserved smoke in the combustion chamber and the release of grey smokefrom the chimney. Successively two more tubes broke, and swellingcaused them to open longitudinally for about 20 cm. From the positionof the two tubes, one in a high corner opposite to the initial brokentube, and the other in the upper convection chamber, it was deducedthat they were reached by a jet of product which overheated themlocally. The consequent and massive product release worsened thesituation of the combustion with emission of a black smoke cloud fromthe chimney. Part of the product also exited the oven propagating thefire to the outside.",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  The accident in the refinery involved the oven F1801 of the Visbreaking process in the Residues Section used in the thermal cracking of the distillation residue in order to obtain medium to light distillates. The oven has two radiant chambers and a convection zone. In the two chambers the combustion of the fuel oil for the heating of the input distillates circulating in the tubes surrounding the chamber occurs. The convection zone also has various series of tubes. The first indication of a malfunction was an anomalous temperature increase (+6 degrees Celsius) observed on the thermal element in the oven output. The operator noticed a light smoke in a combustion chamber and after verification of the correct lighting of the burners, initiated the alarm for low percentage of oxygen in the smoke of the combustion. At a second inspection he also discovered a small hole in a tube of the serpentine. It was then decided to shut down the plant in a controlled way following the procedures described in the operating manual for losses of small scale, which required the shut-down of the burner in the near chamber (the involved chamber was kept running in order to burn the product escaping from the hole) and reducing the income flow to the minimum value.The situation in the combustion chamber worsened when two other tubes began to leak and the flame propagated externally up to a few meters outside the chamber. The plant was then rapidly shut-down and the emergency ended quickly with the burn-out of the flame in the internal of the chamber due to the consumption of the fuel, the use of a vapour jet, and the extinguishment of the external flame with the use of foam by the emergency intervention forces internal to the refinery. The incomplete combustion caused the release of a dense cloud composed by the combustion products from the chimney to about 500m in the west direction towards the first houses of the village of Rocca Priora.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The accident originated from the rupture of a tube, located about 3/4 of the height in the first pass in the combustion chamber (side Ancona), and later involved other two tubes, one in the same chamber and another down in the convection chamber. In a first internal report of the company two hypothesis were put forward: either partial obstruction of the tube passage due to an anomalous detaching of the coke, which normally forms a layer inside the tube, or a defect of the material of the tube at the point of the rupture. From the successive analysis of temperature of the tube passages and the product flows, the technical note supports as the most plausible hypothesis the material defect of the tube which was the origin of the first loss, and which would not have been evident during the normal operation of the plant.The hypotheses put forward on the accident causes (material defect or less probable, anomalous detachment of coke with partial obstruction of the tube) permit the following considerations. The ruptured tube was in the zone of maximum opening of the flame that is under greater thermal stress: this reinforces the hypothesis of the existence of a tube defect in this zone. As far as the possible coke detachment is concerned, the scientific literature says that in the visbreaking processes of the refineries there are undesired phenomena of asphaltenes precipitation due to incompatibility between the supply load and the derived products. These agglomeration phenomena are facilitated by the increase of the severity of the visbreaking process. It is important for this to better evaluate the chemical and physico-chemical characterisation of the fuel arriving in the refinery before processing it. process analysis",

In the first phase a local fire occurred near the atmospheric vessel called TK103, containing a solution of NaOH in water of the RT1 plant (revamping topping) and used for neutralizing the acidity of the raw oil contained in the desalter of the TK2 plant. The fire caused damage to the tank and to the electrical cables running near the vessel. This fire has been definitively extinguished at 9.25. In the second phase at 9.45, an explosion occurred at the exit of the tube from the preheating oven (F301) of gasoil + H2 of the desulphurisation plant. This explosion damaged, besides the oven, various equipment in a radius of about 50 m from the explosion point. The fire following this explosion was of short duration.First incident: probable underevaluation, by the assigned to the operation, considered as of routine and then not at risk. Second incident: on the base of the available registrations, the cause may have been a series of erroneous consecutive actions by the operator who misinterpreted the instruments indications, and his disposition for the conduction of the process.The consequences of the second incident could have been more serious (not only with damage to structures, but also to people- it needs to be noted that the incident occurred in a zone in which numerous personnel, either internal or external, were present for the modifications going on the near-by plants), if the all clear internal alarm was given immediately after the end of the first accident; in that case many persons would have returned to their job and would have been taken by surprise by the second accident.

The overflowing hydrocarbons reached the zone in which workers performed the welding. The following fire and the extinguishing operations caused the activation of the protection devices of the grounding system, which resulted in interruption of the electrical supply. Such interruption provoked the gasoil supply loss in the oven F301 in which the second accident occurred. The increase in the temperature and pressure inside the pipes in which gasoil + H2 should have circulated occurred due to this supply loss, with consequent overheating of the pipes resulting in rupture and explosion. Also in this case, a human error can be reasonably presumed, based on the available computerised registrations, consisting of the undue silencing of alarms due to insufficient supply and of high temperature and pressure and the subsequent omitted interventions as foreseen by the existing procedures. training/instruction vessel/container/containment-equipment failure operator error utilities failure (electricity, gas, water, steam air, etc.)",

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  An explosion followed by small fires occurred inside a hall (hangar, industrial building) of the establishment, in which mixing and dilution operations were carried out. The explosion occurred while two workers were concluding (finishing) the loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose scales of a mixer (dissolver) of 4 m3 containing ethyl acetate. The nitrocellulose was stored in barrels (kegs) and was poured in the hopper of a worm feeder equipped with a shielded (explosion protected) motor. Small fires developed following the ignition of flammable materials (rags, ink tanks, resins, pigments) present in the hall (hangar). The few barrels (kegs) near the mixer which had still to be charged did not catch fire. The two operators (workers) were injured, but not as seriously as a worker a few metres from the hall (hangar) who was carrying out transport operations of barrels (kegs) with a lift truck (3rd degree burns), he has been hit by the flash. Another worker who was working in a laboratory adjacent to the hall (hangar) when the explosion occurred was seriously injured by a separating wall which fell down due to the pressure wave.The causes of the accident have not yet been identified, the starting point has also not been determined. Nevertheless it is plausible to assume that the explosion occurred externally of the mixer, due to the fact that the lid of the mixer stayed in its place (original position). The explosion should have had the characteristics of a deflagration. The loading (filling, charging) with nitrocellulose is performed by inserting feed-line (supply line) through a hatch located on the mixer lid. Eye witnesses have stated that they have seen a flash (fire) develop more or less at the same time of (concurrently to) the blast (explosion). The flash (fire) has fully hit the worker on the lift truck, severely burning him. The equipment (appliances) inside the hall (building) do not show evident damages.The explosion occurred when the loading (charging) operation with nitrocellulose was almost terminated (finished).The access to the hall is blocked due to the demolition (collapse) of the structure. As a consequence it has been impossible at the moment to find any element for identifying the causes and the ignition source.The two operators have declared to have followed the standard procedures. Regular training courses are held for the personnel.The witnesses present have moreover declared to have smelled the presence of ethyl acetate vapours, which are recognisable through the intense smell.More or less at the same time as the explosion a violent flash (fire) developed which has hit plainly one operator which was driving a lift truck a few metres outside the hall (hangar).

        "causes_description": "causes:  The accident may have originated from the ignition of vapours probably released from the hatch and accumulated (concentrated) in the corner of the hall due to insufficient internal ventilation. The release may have also occurred through the flanging of the lid. The mixers are ignition shielded with a nitrogen atmosphere with a light over-pressure. Small probes (detectors) inside the mixer connected to an alarm monitor (detect ) the Oxygen (O2) concentration. The alarm is calibrated at 3% oxygen content and another at 0.5 bar (atmospheres). There has been no alarm before the explosion, nor, according to the persons present at that time, has there been any persistent smell due to the presence of ethyl acetate.The ignition source is unknown.Both workers charged with the filling operation affirm to have followed standard procedures. One of the workers had been engaged since a few months.",

The mixer in question did not showserious damages, due to the fact that the explosion occurred mostprobably above the mixer. The motor of the feeder was thrown(projected) at a distance of 2.5 m (metres) from the mixer, whereas thescrew (worm) of the feeder although being damaged, stayed in its place,and turned over laterally (on a side) due to the pressure wave. Manywindows broke in the buildings of the establishment up to 200 m fromthe explosion point. There have been no effects off-site (outside of)the establishment.People - Remarks: 13 persons were injured ofwhich 5 not seriously which were dismissed from hospital the next day,6 of the other 8 received a prognosis between 30 and 60 days, the othertwo a reserved prognosis. One of the seriously injured received 3rd(third) degree burns on 70% of the body whereas the other one sufferedfrom a head injury, multiple fractures and a liver injury.There were 20 persons present in the hall when the accident occurred.It has not been considered necessary to include in the population atrisk the other workers present in the establishment (approx. 250others), although they may have been exposed to the risk of injury fromthe projection of fragments (glass in particular).There has been no damage to the personnel of the emergency relief teamsnor to persons outside the establishment.Ecological harm - Remarks: The fire extinguishing water was collected in the used water recovery tanks of the establishmentMaterial loss - Remarks: Damage to equipment has still to be evaluated. Relevant damages to the structures of hall No. 13 and to a lot of windows (glazing) of the buildings in the establishment. The economic damages have therefore still to be quantified.Disruption of community life: There has been no interruption of services outside the establishment. The accident has had a resonance at national level due to its gravity (seriously injured workers) as well as due to the singularity of its dynamic.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment"

This shut down operation involved the realisation of a by-pass for the part of the plant involved, operation which was foreseen by the emergency plan, with the assistance of the onsite fire brigade. At the same time the voluntary fire brigades of Merano, Maia Bassa, Maia Alta, Quarazze, Montefranco, Postal, Lana, Lagundo and Marlengo arrived, having been alerted by some person passing by who had seen the fumes (smoke). When the personnel identified the source of the fumes as a release of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) which combined with water (H2O), forms hydrochloric acid (HCl), which actually occurred due to the presence of humidity in the air and in the soil, forming a visible column of white fumes (smoke); the personnel proceeded in realising a vertical water barrier (curtain, in compliance with the emergency plan, in order to avoid the displacement of the fumes (Smoke) due to the wind, attempting at the same time to avoid the direct contact of the water with the SiCl4 . The fire fighting teams which arrived from offsite attempted, on the command of their coordinators, to abate the fumes (smoke) without any discrimination with water hydrants. This caused the intensification of the chemical reaction described above. Further to the water also a special foam (suitable for non-flammable products) of RID class 8 type was employed.

The tank does not have a retention cuvette.The vaporisation of the hydrocarbons led to the formation of some 60m. of vapour cloud, which extended to the nearby Provincial road Arquata Scrivia - Vignole B.According to witnesses, the cloud was ignited by the passage of two lorries. There was heard a first explosion, followed some seconds later by two more. Immediately after that fires were found on the roof of the tank and on the nearby transfer vessel.

        "causes_description": "causes:  In order to avoid icing of the tank, and to optimise subsequent water treatment, the tank is warmed internally to a temperature of 20-30 C by steam heat exchangers at the bottom of the tank. Preliminary investigations by the company suggest that steam may have leaked from the heat exchanger coils, thereby overheating the water, and hence also the hydrocarbons, which were therefore released through the vent hole.After further investigation:There would appear to have been an anomalous increase in temperature, perhaps caused by steam escaping from the heating system. However, at the time of writing this cannot be confirmed because the tank is still being emptied. Only once this is finished will it be possible to carry out a visual inspection of the roof and of the heating system. vessel/container/containment-equipment failure",

The two vehicles travellingon the nearby road were damaged, as noted in short report, as well asthe service vehicle of the drainage tank operator which was parked nearthe tank. The shock wave broke some windows in the porters' lodge 100metres from the tank. In total, the vapour cloud affected an area ofabout 60 metres from the tank towards the external road. There was nopermanent damage outside the establishment.People - remarks:The drivers of the two lorries involved, which were proceeding in opposite directions on the Provincial road, were both injured, and taken to hospital. They were expected to heal in 7 and 15 days. As far as damage outside the plant is concerned, the two lorries were damaged, one in the cabin and the other on its canvas cover. Within the plant, there were damaged the tank concerned, and also a car used for internal movements.Ecological harm - remarks:The particulate material resulting from the combustion of the hydrocarbons was not dispersed into the atmosphere because of the meteorological conditions (snowing) and the amount involved. It was deposited immediately round the tank.Community Disruption - remarks:The provincial road was closed for about 1.5 hours, and, as a precaution, the inhabitants of some of the surrounding houses, as well as the staff of a nearby establishment (a materials depot), were evacuated for about an hour.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local"

The accident was reported to ATRIG, the same day, by phone, luckily there was never the risk that the accident scenario could evolve by involving other process units of the installation or that it could reach outside the Refinery.wind intensity higher than normal for that period of the year, causing the dispersion of the product originating from the leak (release), towards the interior of the unit.Discussion about occurrence:Durig the shift which started at 22:00 h of the 18/06/97 and which finished at 6:00 h of the 19/06/97, Unit 2000 of the lubricating oil plant was in start-up phase (condition), after having been shut-down for scheduled maintenance work.The accident started (originated) in the heat exchanger E 2007 B, when that unit in which the heat exchanger is integrated was very near to reach normal operating conditions. It was foreseen that at the end of that shift the unit would have reached normal operating conditions.When the accident occurred, at 02:20 h of 19/06/1997, unit 2000 was at the final start-up stage, it remained only to introduce rectification vapour in column T 2002, raise the temperature to normal operating values in furnaces H 2001 and H 2002, the feed (charge) of crude oil was of 90 m3/h (cubic metres an hour), the crude oil exiting from H 2001 had a temperature of 320 C and the residues exiting from H 2002 had approx.the same temperature. Distillation products were collected already in both columns and were to be deviated through slops until information on the quality of the product was obtained.Until the accident everything had been going on normally. Attention must be drawn to the fact, that after the shut-down of the unit and the performance of major maintenance operations it is normal that minor leaks (releases) occur in equipment, the leaks are eliminated by tightening the fastening (fixing) elements. This is the reason why in those circumstances the start-up of the units is performed slower in order to allow the detection of possible (eventual) anomalies (disturbances), avoiding that these present a significant risk.In fact the start up was to be slow, for the reasons indicated above, moreover there had been a certain delay due to a leak which occurred in heat exchanger E 2001, which led to the reduction of the discharge. The introduction of the pipes of the heat exchangers in the respective (corresponding) bodies was made with the help of cradles in order to avoid forcing or deforming the equipment, and thus to damage it.The inspection services made a hydrostatic test on the heat exchanger (at a pressure of 37 kg on the body and 24 kg on the pipes, during one hour) after it had been assembled; according to the results of the acceptance test there had been no need of re-tightening.An operator of Unit 2000 detected the leak (release) which was at the origin of the accident; while he was putting into operation one burner of the furnace H 2002 he saw a very large cloud inside that unit, originating in the upper part (top) of one of the connection joints between the body and the primary chamber (antechamber) of the heat exchanger E 2007B, on the north side. The release assumed the form of a fan and pushed by the wind, which was blowing strongly, it moved towards column T 2005. The detection of the leak (release) occurred between 02:15 h and 02:20 h and was immediately communicated to the control room. At 02:20 the product originating from the leak (release) ignited (took fire) in the area corresponding to the pumps P 2008 A and B. The fire expanded rapidly in direction of column T 2005, reaching the base of D 2002. False False False False conflagration (a general engulfment fire) jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice)",

Concerning material damage the whole pump room and several transfer pipe sections were completely destroyed. Both tanks TK231 and TK232 were severely damaged in the upper section, while tank TK326 showed damages in its external coating. In the electrical substation a partition wall collapsed, while the other walls were fissured and electrical appliances were damaged. Damage due to the fire was also found in the roofs of the nearest diesel loading platforms. As a precautionary measure the prefect ordered the interruption of traffic on the Flaminia main road running along the refinery and the Ancona - Bologna railway running through the establishment. The activity of the nearby Raffaello-Sanzio airport was interrupted, both because the fire combustion cloud could have affected the landing and take-off paths of the airplanes and because the airport fire fighters were participating in the emergency response operations at the refinery with specialised equipment taken from the airport.The cloud caused by the fire, containing hydrocarbon combustion products was seen by the population of Falconara. The explosions consequent to the fire were heard by a part of the population of Falconara Marittima, which is located at a certain distance from the refinery.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishment"

The process comprises 4 steps:Step 1 - mononitrationStep 2 - reductive alkylation of 4-nitroxyleneStep 3 - dinitration of the intermediateStep 4 - purification and washing of the Pendimethalin.The accident occurred during step 3 in the nitric acid concentration section and involved the distillation column C320 and the dedicated reboiler E320, connected to the column by natural circulation.The cause of the accident is still under investigation by the competent judicial authorities; however, based on the declarations of the company, it can be supposed that the event initiated with the bursting of the bottom of the distillation column and the reboiler connected to the same column. The blast wave consequent to the explosion hurled one of the two road tankers parked nearby on a second road tanker. The road tanker hurled by the blast wave contained nitric acid with a ca. 40% concentration, resulting from the purging of the column bottom, whereas the road tanker which was hit was empty. The projection of missiles on the plant structures consequent to the explosion caused among other consequences, also cracks on the tank containing nitric acid and its release. A fire developed also affecting only the immediate surroundings of the explosion within a radius of a few metres, according to an estimate based on the effects left by the flames. According to the estimates of the company, the smoke column produced by the fire reached a height of 20 metres and shifted towards a nearby highway. The process substances and residues which were released by the explosion, were subsequently washed away by the extinguishing water used by the Finchimica fire brigade and were collected in the final emergency containment basin, with a capacity of ca. 1.600 m= (1400m= were collected following the accident), the plant personnel put the basin immediately into service for the successive treatment in the sewage treatment plant. During the collecting phase of the extinguishing water in the basin, a not perfectly closed interception valve allowed a certain amount of the extinguishing water to leak into the municipal sewage system and from there into an open air channel named colatore Moloncello.

Concerning the evolution of the released combustion gases, the ASL, which intervened on a call of the 118 emergency response service, established, as declared in its report, the absence of a continuous diffusion of combustion gases in the atmosphere.Technicians of the SOPI (Operative Structure for Emergency Response of the ASL) carried out the necessary tests excluding the presence in the atmosphere of nitric acid, combustion gases as COx, NOx, SOx, hydrocyanic acid, and all other organic substances with a xylene infrared absorption spectrum.The ASL itself has taken waste water samples (processing water, extinguishing water, etc.) for analysis; the results are under evaluation by the competent authorities.Concerning material damage, the accident caused on-site consequences as well as off-site consequences.On-site the installation:- building 1 and 2 with damage to equipment and structures,- the two road tankers affected by the blast wave and missile projection are out of service,- the control room of the office building with damages to the external walls, windows, and in the control room damage to the ceiling panelling.In a more detailed way, in the control room windows and ceiling panelling were damaged by the pressure wave. The external walls were damaged by missiles projections of structural elements from buildings 1 and 2.The largest metal fragment found weighs 120-130 kg.A missile pierced the external metallic fence of the liquid hydrogen storage tank located ca. 60 m from the explosion point, without damaging the tank itself because it was shielded by building 2. Moreover the blast wave, which expanded mostly on the N-S axis which was not protected by large buildings reached also, apart from the already mentioned control room, the laboratory building and the management office building some 150 m away, causing the rupture of windows in both of them.Off-site, within a radius of 400 m, a few buildings were affected by rupture of windows and some missile projection. Metallic fragments were found onsite within a radius of 100 m and some others over the enclosure wall within a distance of 40-60 m from the wall (perforations with a maximum size of some dozen cm).In a more detailed way concerning off-site consequences, using the establishment as orientation point:- eastwards, highway and mainly agricultural land, no damage has been reported until now.- northwards, two farm buildings, the first at a distance of 120 m, suffered broken windows, whereas the second, at a distance of 220 m, did not suffer any damage.- westwards, some private buildings and some installations being part of the industrial area, broken windows were reported.- southwards toll-gate of the highway (ca. 100 m) and the industrial area, no damage was reported.Ecological Harm - Remarks:As already mentioned before, the territorial competent ASL is analysing the drawn water samples, in order to define the extent and magnitude of damage caused by the release of extinguishing water into the sewage system.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local"

The investigation showed that the washer, the separating metal plate with the relative gaskets and the sealing bolt of the gasket were missing on this valve assembly. All the missing parts except the bolt were later found inside the tank when it was inspected after cleaning operations; it is likely that the bolt was thrown out into the air.According to the design, in normal working of the valve assembly the central position of the gasket connects the tank with both safety valves, whereas by changing the position of the gasket towards one of the safety valve connections that valve can be dismantled and serviced. In the specific case, the missing gasket prevented the closing of the connection with the safety relief valve, causing the release of LPG and the ejection of the safety relief valve which was being dismantled by the worker during the scheduled periodic calibration. It is therefore assumed that a defect occurred in the slide valve due to a defective tightening of the bolt holding the sealing gasket.The initiating cause of the accident was probably the sealing gasket in the slide valve of the safety valve assembly slipping out of its seat and preventing the sealing of the valve seat opening of the safety valve which was being dismantled.However, the worker who was present at the accident stated that the gas detection device of the slide valve, consisting in a vent-hole, did not indicate detection of the presence of gas, which would have prevented him, according to the safety procedures, from dismantling the safety valve. component/machinery failure/malfunction instrument/control/monitoring-device failure other other",

At the re-distillation column bottom, hydroxylamine was concentrated to 80-85%, and was circulated in the middle of the column. A crude 50% solution of hydroxylamine was charged into the circulating high-concentration hydroxylamine. Then the hydroxylamine solution was heated to evaporate some part of the hydroxylamine. Next, in the column, 50% hydroxylamine vapor went to the top of the column and a 80% hydroxylamine solution dropped to the bottom. As a ferrous ion contained in feedstock at about 50 ppb is reduced to 1 ppb or less in the product, part of the circulation liquid was drawn out from the bottom circulation line. Emergency blow-down piping was installed at the underside of the bottom circulation piping to draw out column fluid in an emergency, and a block valve was installed just apart from the branching point. Very short piping from the branch to the block valve was dead-end piping. The major cause is as follows: A very small amount of ferrous ions in the circulation liquid dropped to the dead-end piping, and accumulated gradually. The accumulated iron caused exothermic decomposition, and detonation was propagated from the re-distillation column bottom. unexpected reaction/phase-transition Yes",

The explosions destroyed two dryers, a building for the weighing and dosage of the crude substances utilised for the production of cartridges powders and a reinforced concrete building (unused since the last world war waiting for demolition).In the weighing room (22 F and G) some polyethylene tanks caught fire but this was limited only to that room False False False False explosive decomposition (of unstable material)",
        "causes_description": "causes:  To verify the probable causes the competent authority sequestrated the plant, beginning an investigation and nominating a CTU expert.Actually it is impossible to give any precise information regarding the event as the outcome of the inspection is not yet public.However the establishment gave some detailed evaluation through the Delegate Councilor, see Full Report A Occurrence Point 5. To individuate the probable causes the competent judgemental authority sequestrated the plant, to begin a series of technical examination and verification.The establishment prepared an accident reconstruction as the magistrature did not end its investigation, on the basis of its study and the judgements of an International Technical Committee (called by the AFEMS (Associazione Fabbricanti Europei Munizioni Sportive, European playful munition manufacturer association).We need some introduction deduced by the declaration of the establishment to understand their hypothesis:The establishment produces hunting cartridges, for smooth tube rifle, and powders for this kind of cartridges composed by the 90% of cellulose nitrate, 9% of nitroglycerin and 1% of diphenylamine as stabilizer.Powder is produced mixing the synthesis cellulose nitrate with biscuit, with recovery powder from the discharge of military munitions and recovery hunting powders from production discards, with solvents composed by diphenylamine, combining everything in the paste mixers. Before use the obtained product is subjected to further procedures. The cartridge case are produced by a specific hot procedure of the plastic, the cartridges are prepared in specific rooms with special automatic cycle machines.The water from raw materials used for the powders production is eliminated using the dryers, before their mixing.The establishment is constituted by many infrastructures placed in a quadrangular area with a dimension of 700 x 700 Mt, delimitated by a double perimetric enclosure (the internal one has antintrusion sensors).As regards the accident,  we underline that the explosions occurred in the following infrastructures: - the dryer n  41, where the hunting powders, the recovery powder from the discharge of military munitions and the cellulose nitrate were dehumidified;- the dryer 21N for the cellulose nitrate dehumidification;- the weighing and dosage building (35A) of the raw materials used for the powders production, where arrived the dried substances ready to be mixed;- the bunker complex (10C), totally abandoned;- the weighing and storage building (22F/G) of hunting powders.The explosions caused: - in the unit 10C a crater with the complete destruction of the towering structures. The crater has a diameter of about 9 meters with round borders and sweet curving. This kind of characteristic means that the explosive substance that caused it was a type at a low speed of explosion, a deflagrating one, like a propellant for rockets (military type) that explodes in the floor in a limited environment;- in the dryer 41 there were 560 Kg of cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating two craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;- in the dryer 21N there were 1440 Kg of cellulose nitrate in the drying phase, the accident destroyed the building creating three little craters, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate them;- in the weighing and dosage building 35A there were 1600/1700 Kg of recovery powder and cellulose nitrate, 800/900 Kg of hunting powder , both in the drying phase, and 180 Kg of cellulose nitrate completely dry, the accident destroyed the building creating a crater with a diameter of 10 meters and 3 meters of depth, the morphology underlines that was a deflagrant substance to generate it;- in the building 22F/G 41 there were 3000 Kg of hunting powder in boxes of antistatic polythene, the fire created by the explosion damaged the building structure.To formulate a reliable hypothesis regarding the cause of the explosions, it is needful to consider:- in the unit 10C in the room above the crater there was a conspicuous mass of about 600/700 Kg of deflagrant explosive. The room was covered by reinforced concrete and a thick stratus of ground, vegetation and trees. The next rooms were inaccessible because of unusable opening and covered by vegetation. This material was part of the superfluous war escaped from the reclamation of 1997, as they were confined hermetically in the room;- when the explosion occurred, the dryers 41 and 21N were stopped because the guardian of the establishment had switched off the dryer systems one hour before the accident, intercepting any kind of arriving energy (vapour, electric power). The day of the accident was a no - working day indeed it was Sunday (07/28/2002);- the weighing building 35A was inactive and also when it is working, there isn't any kind of power;- before the first explosion there was a whistle of about 3/4 seconds.On the basis of the consideration mentioned above, it is impossible that the first explosion was in one of the structures 41, 21N, 22 F/G or 35A, as there wasn't power to generate the explosion of the stored substances.After a study of the ground around the buildings 10C, 41, 21N, 22F/G and 35A we believe that the first explosion was in the room 10C and the others were caused by the incandescent fragments.As concern the type of explosive exploded in the room 10C and his priming, it is possible to formulate some probable hypothesis:Explosive type: The exploded mass was composed by deflagrant explosive not inserted in metal boxes. We may say that because of on the strucures nearby the room 10C there weren't marks of splinter, and the crater had a regular morphology, that means that the explosion was linear. If the mass was formed by mortar bombs it would be very different, because of the many continuity solutions.Priming type:The cellulose nitrate and nitroglycerin propellants, as the probable ones of the accident (like propellants for military rockets, never produced in the establishment), during the time they became old, losing the stabilizer. The main substances of the powder begin a dissociation phase, creating an exothermic oxidation that generates HOT SPOTS in the explosive mass. If the warmth in this HOT SPOTS do not disperse in the mass, it may catch fire, creating burning gas and then it may explode. This kind of event is facilitated when the mass is a confined area, as the examined one.The burning gas whizz created before the explosion in the room 10C, it is the whistle heard before the deflagration.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  The overpressure caused by an unforeseen runaway reaction between chlorinated tars and TDI caused the explosion of Tank no. D 528/2 and a subsequent fire. The pressure wave and the carbon dioxide formed by the explosion of the second tank no. D 528/1 extinguished most fires which had developed.The accident occurred in a section of high-boiling tars of the TDI department TD5. In the department TD5 toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) is produced through the reaction of 2,4-toluendiamine (TDA) and phosgene.The reaction is performed in 3 successive steps with increasing temperature from approximately 80 C to 170 C, with decreasing pressure and hydrogen chloride acid as a by-product.In the section of high-boiling tars, described in the attached block-diagram (ref. Attachment 2), a part of TDI is recovered in a vacuum batch process from the mixture containing 50% TDI and 50% high-boiling tars, stored in tank D 522, which is equipped with a stirrer and water refrigerated coils.The TDI is recovered by evaporation in the concentrator D 525/1, equipped with a stirrer, steam heated coils and maintained at vacuum pressure.Concentrator D 525/1 is fed by the tanks D 528/1-2-3 acting also as compensation tanks. The TDI vapours are then condensed and the liquid then transferred for storage, the residual gas is sent through a separator and then suctioned by the 3stage vacuum units P 509/1-3. The concentrate present in D 525/1 is composed of 18-20% TDI and for the remaining part of high-boiling tars is diluted with toluene, mixed and transferred over a pump in tank D 541, where it is continuously stirred at a temperature of 115 - 120 C with the objective of obtaining a sufficiently fluid and stable mass to be sent into the incinerator B 502/2 for combustion.On 26/11/2002 at about 17:40 the shift assistant of department TD 4-5 shut down the stirrer P 507 of tank D 522 due to the excessive noise of the reduction gear of the motor caused by an insufficient lubrication (memo in the logbook).Following the shutting down of the stirrer P 705 the temperature in tank D 544 started to rise gradually and stabilised at 125 C according to the value recorded by the DCS (Distributed Control System) switchboard assistant. These values cannot be considered reliable due to the fact that the instrument T 5-258 was calibrated to measure temperatures up to 120 C. Tank D 522 receiving the high-boiling tars and the TDI from the evaporator D 521 operates at a maximum temperature of approximately 95 C in normal operating conditions.On 27/11/2002 at 7:30 hrs the feed to tank D 522 is reduced from 400 kg/h to 1900 kg/h maintaining the water circulation in the cooling coils of tank D 522 constant. The reduction of the feed charge reduced the temperature in tank D 522 to 65 C. At approximately 12:00 hrs on 27/11/2002 the temperature of tank D 522 rose again in connection with the increased load of the evaporator D 521, which went up from the previous 1700 kg/h to 7000 kg/h. For the remaining part of 27/11/2002 and until approximately 17:30 hrs on 28/11/2002, when the stirrer was started again, the DCS registered a temperature beyond the top of the measurement scale (above 120 C). At 4:00 hrs on 28/11/2002 the shift personnel registered a temperature rise in tanks D528/1-2-3 and on the work sheet the temperature marked for tanks D 528/1-2-3 were respectively 136-142 and 131 C. The operating temperature normally foreseen for the tanks is 105 C.The switchboard operator reported to the shift assistant an abnormal batch distillation, characterised by the rapidity of the same and the low amount of distilled product, the temperature of D 525/1 was 139 C instead of 105-110  expected at the beginning of the distillation.The operation manual did not indicate the measures to be adopted in case of high temperatures in D 522 and D 528/1-2-3.In the meantime, at 16:30 on 28/11/2002 tank 528/2 filled to 60% reached the temperature of 170 C.The design temperature of the equipment D528/1-2-3 is 150 C.At 18:00 hrs the temperature in tank D 528/2 reached 181 C and it was not possible to discharge tank D 528/2 because distillation was in progress in D25/1 and tank D541 feeding the incinerator B 502/2 was full and could not receive the high-boiling tars from D 525/1.Only at 18:35, when the distillation process in D 525/1 finished, could the discharge into D 541 be performed, only at this point did D 541 have the capacity to receive the content of D 525/1.At 18:50 valve XV 5316 was opened to start the discharge operation of tank 528/2 into tank D 525/1; in that point tank D 528/2, with a nominal capacity of 10m3, was 59.5% full and the temperature 220.7 C. The attempt to discharge tank D 528/2 did not succeed, due to the fact that the not homogenous product inside the tank contained solid matter which blocked the discharge of the tank. Inside the tank unwanted chemical reactions had been going on for hours with development of gas and increase of the temperature and viscosity of the reaction mass.Four external contractors approached the distillation unit D 525/1 to verify the conditions inside the unit through a visual inspection window installed on the dome cap. A dense white smoke inside the distillation unit did not allow the workers to look inside the equipment and the pipe connecting tank D 528/2 to the rupture disk was particularly hot. At 19:25 a second attempt to discharge the tank was made but failed, the temperature on the control panel indicated 220 C while there was no means to measure the pressure inside the vessel. At 19:30 the four external contractors were still in the plant verifying the hydraulic guard D 583 when a strong whistling was heard and white smoke leaking from the flanged coupling located on the delivery tube of the distillation unit D 525/1 was seen. Instinctively the four external contractors tried to escape but a strong explosion was heard, at 19:42 hrs tank D 528/2 exploded. The tank contained a mixture of TDI and TDI high-boiling tars. The pressure wave of the explosion made one escaping worker fall while all were hit and covered by a dense, warm, half solid substance with a high viscosity and a granular structure. After a few (dozen) seconds a fire developed.The explosion ignited a fire involving the terminal part (southern side) of the framework of the TDI high-boiling tars processing department. The fire was mainly fed by 20 tons of diathermic oil (Aerthem 320) and one ton of toluene due to the rupture of the corresponding pipes.The fire affected the second of the three TDI and high-boiling tars storage tanks, D 528/1 (85% full when the accident occurred), causing its mechanical failure and releasing the second explosion at approximately 20:25 hrs. The explosion of tank D 528/1 extinguished the main fire leaving only some residual secondary fires.

D522 and then developed in tank D 528/2, with the release of heat and carbon dioxide causing the mechanical explosion of tank D 528/1 due to overpressure.The high temperatures and the prolonged residence time of the mass in D 528/2 (approximately 13 hours), supported the development of exothermic condensation reactions or reactions associated with the formation of carbon dioxide and a significant pressure increase.When the explosion occurred the internal temperature of tank D 528/2 was above 220 C and clearly the tank was in extreme overpressure conditions. When the event occurred the tank was filled to 60% of its design capacity of 10 m3.A study has been performed by the Dow, on the thermal stability of the substances involved in the accident and in particular on the results of the adiabatic calorimetric tests (ARC) performed on a tar sample collected immediately after the accident from tank D 522, with the goal of understanding the behaviour of the substances involved in the accident.The tests were made by heating a known quantity of material composed by high-boiling tars and TDI in an adiabatic thermal system and registering the temperature and pressure evolution over time. This test simulated the heating process of the product in D 528/2 involved in the explosion. The test results agree basically with the values registered by the DCS during the accident and demonstrated the development of two distinct reactions, one exothermic reaction and another one developing carbon dioxide.The rupture disk failed due to a plug formed of hardened foam of the boiling mass on the pipe connecting the tank with the rupture disk and the venting manifold. organized procedures training/instruction component/machinery failure/malfunction unexpected reaction/phase-transition",

Of these only 4 external contractors needed medical treatment as specified below.Composition of the emergency response teams: - The EniChem fire brigade intervened with a team of 12 persons;- The national fire brigade intervened with a team of 52 persons.Persons involved off-site.- The population was not involved in the accidental event.- The distance from the urban quarter C# Emiliani (population of 10,000 inhabitants) of Porto Marghera is approximately 2500 m.- The distance from the village of Malcontenta (population of 1,000 inhabitants) is approximately 1,1250mImmediate or subsequent fatalities: No fatalities were registeredHospitalised injuries: Nobody was hospitalisedInjuries not requiring hospitalisationThe 4 external workers who were performing controls in proximity of the plant equipment were involved in the accident but were only partially exposed to the effects of the explosion of tank D 528/2. All received first medical treatment at the infirmary of the petrochemical establishment and then at the emergency department of the hospital Umberto I in Mestre.The medical reports of the emergency department contain following diagnosis:Worker No. 1: 3 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 02/12/02), due to pharyngeal hyperaemia and facial erythema.Worker No. 2: 31 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 30/12/02), due to I and II degree burns on the scalp.Worker No. 3: 31 days of incapacity to work(from 28/11/02 to 30/12/02), due to the consequences of exposure to toxic industrial substances.Worker No. 4: 53 days of incapacity to work (from 28/11/02 to 21/01/03), due to the after effects of a trauma caused by a contusion associated with a distortion of the right knee and state of reactive anxiety.Hospitalised persons: There were no hospitalised injuries (the Italian says non-hospitalised injuries)Persons put under health monitoring programs: There have been no persons put under health monitoring programs consequent to the accidental vent occurred.Ecological Harm - Remarks:Consequent to the accident that occurred on 28/11/02 the personnel of the Antipollution department of the Water Magistracy of Venice (SAMA) performed a series of controls on the drains of the site. Considering the position in which the accident occurred, it was considered appropriate to concentrate on the community sewage drain SM15. During the days following the accident controls were made not only on sewage drain SM15 but also on the section drain SM15/3 directly connected to the TDI production department and on the drain SM15/22 of the central biological sewage treatment plant of the installation, which might have suffered consequences from the event.Both drains form the general drain SM15. Moreover, on 04/12/2002 all drains of the installation were controlled. The timing of the controls and detailed data of the samples are annexed. It has to be stated that the sampling method adopted was of instantaneous type and that all sampling operations and analysis were performed in compliance with regulations and in presence of the party.Moreover it has to be stated that the analysis of TDI (toluene di-isocyante) and aromatic amines showed the presence of TDI with concentrations corresponding to 5280 mg/l and traces of aromatic amines (0.2 mg/l of aniline, 0,1 mg/l of p-toluidine). The concentration values of dichlorobenzenes (chlorinated solvents not mentioned elsewhere) and of organic aromatic solvents (toluene)- all compounds used in the production process involved in the accident - were also particularly high.During the inspection on 29/11/2002 two successive sampling operations were performed on the terminal gully of drain SM15/3 with the goal of verifying the characteristics of the effluents discharged in two distinct periods. This procedure was adopted following the observation during the inspection that the characteristics of the effluents varied strongly.Annex 2 of the present report (annex no 2) lists the values of the samples taken during several inspections made on drain SM15/3 resulting above the threshold values defined by D.P.R. 962/73 and D.M. 30.7.1999. Drain SM 15/3 discharges into the main sewage channel conventionally called SM15, which discharges into the lagoon via the Malamocco-Marghera Channel. It has to be mentioned that the sewage discharged by drain SM15/3 is not subject to any additional treatment downstream of the terminal gully from which the samples were taken. Only in one sample, corresponding to record no. 2663 taken on 29/11/2002, were traces of TDI found (15 mg/l), while in the samples taken afterwards the concentrations of the compound were below the sensitivity of the test method adopted.In conclusion it is considered that consequent to the accident that occurred on 28/11/2002 at the establishment Dow Poliuretani Italia Srl drain SM 15/3 caused a temporary but consistent pollution of the lagoon water. The polluting substances were channelled into the lagoon via the general drain SM15 of the establishment, spreading in the aquatic environment and modifying the chemical characteristics of the water in the lagoon up to 1 km from the establishment. #omisis#The characteristics of the fire and the atmospheric conditions characterised by very slight wind and stability probably favoured an umbrella like fallout pattern of the pollutants around the establishment, which resulted quite uniform, with peak concentrations in the SW sector in the direction of the monitoring stations of via Bottenigo and of Malcontenta and with slightly lower concentrations in the opposite sector in the direction of the city of Mestre.The TDI fire and of the other substances present in the installation caused an increase of the substances typical for combustion processes (nitrogen oxides, carbon oxide and hydrocarbons in a minor proportion), even if the absolute values measured are comparable with the values measured during traffic peak hours in stable meteorological conditions.The increase of toluene is much more significant and to a minor extent the increase of Ethyl-benzene and Xylenes; the absolute values were higher, although not much higher, than the values measured at peak hours of days with high traffic rates.It is interesting to note how the concentration ratio toluene/benzene increased by a factor between 7 and 8 with respect to normal traffic conditions, which may indicate the presence of toluene originating from the accidental event.Moreover the values measured for styrene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, trimethylbenzene do not differ much from the values indicated in literature for highly urbanised and industrialised areas.It is important to note the absence of dichlorobenzenes in all air samples of the urban areas, even the ones taken in the most critical fallout phase, whereas dichlorobenzenes were found in significant concentrations in proximity of the accident place even the morning after the fire.The concentration of hydrogen chloride measured on the over-bridge in Mestre, in the peak fallout time (between 22:00 and 23:00) is also worthy of note; it could no longer be detected the next morning.The concentrations of dioxins, furans, and PCBs similar to dioxins, measured by CO.INCA (Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale Chimica per l\u00edAmbiente \u00f1 Interuniversitary Consortium foe Environmental Chemistry) on the total particulate were undoubtedly low, the total values were comparable with the background concentration levels indicated by literature for urban areas.At time of the present report, the research for organic micro-pollutants on the atmospheric particulate and on ash-sludge in the fire zone, was still in progress."

No: 133-74-0, compressed highly flammable gas (F+, R12); can form explosive mixtures with air, can react violently with oxidants; approximately 300 kg of pure hydrogen were released.Gas mixture of methane (C.A.S. No: 74-82-8), ethane (C.A.S. No: 74-84-0), propane (C.A.S. No: 74-98-6) and butane (C.A.S. No: 106-97-8). Extremely flammable non toxic mixture. Approximately 2700 kg were released.H2 was the most dangerous substance in the released mixture.Total released quantities (approximation):- 3 tons gas highly flammable gas mixture from the isomerisation unit and 0.3 t mixture of the BenSat unit, in total approximately 3.3 tons of highly flammable gas mixture with 70% volume of H2, corresponding to approximately 10% in weight.- 6 tons gasoline from the isomerisation unit and 6 t gasoline present in the BenSat for a total of 12 tons of gasoline.ISOMERISATION UNITThe quantity of released substances was estimated considering the volumes of the plant section involved (isomerisation unit); it has been estimated that a quantity of 3 tons of hydrogen rich gas mixture was present; while based on the volume of the two separators, considered to be filled to 50%, the amount of gasoline present was estimated at 6 tons.The amount of hydrogen rich gas mixture released corresponds to 3 tons, because the feed of the hydrogen rich gas mixture was cut off in the first phase of the accident by the automatic emergency shut-down system of the plant; subsequently the manual valves located on the feed line of the gas mixture from the platformer and the valves installed at the battery limit were closed. The amount of hydrogen rich gas mixture released by the compressor in the first phase of the accident was estimated using as a reference the progressive gas pressure decrease registered; during the first 4 minutes approximately 2.5 tons of gas mixture were released.BENSAT UNITFrom the volume of the plant section the quantity of hydrogen rich mixture was estimated at approximately 0.3 tons, while the amount of gasoline present was estimated at 6 tons. It was assumed that all the product present fed the fire, while the feeding of the plant was shut-off at the beginning of the occurrence.The estimated total quantities of released substances correspond therefore to 3.3 tons of hydrogen rich gas mixture and 12 tons of gasoline.The continuous process is fed by large capacity tanks. In estimating the potential quantities that could have been involved in absence of safety measures, it was assumed that at least the manual valves at the battery limits would have been shut-off. The operator declared that maximally 7000 m3 of hydrogen rich gas mixture and approximately 20 tons of products in liquid phase could have been released from the two units involved, if only the feed lines at the battery limits had been shut.Maximum amount of substances registered in the plant inventory- approximately 25,000 m3 of hydrogen rich gas mixture, therefore 1,500 m3 of pure hydrogen (approximately 1,5 tons).- 147000 t of liquid automotive petrol.The establishment extends over a surface of 100 ha.

The compressors, which were working in parallel and were operating at a pressure of 20 bars, were dedicated to conveying the gas mixture needed for the isomerisation process. The rupture caused the release of a gas mixture containing hydrogen, which on coming into contact with air ignited forming a jet fire. The jet fire headed towards the adjacent benzene saturation (BenSat) section hitting the nearest equipment (a pressure vessel) located 14 m from the release point. Weakening of the BenSat structure, consequent release of benzene from these structures and extension of the fire, with substantial destruction of the section. The length of the jet-fire could not be calculated with precision because the flame hit against the nearby BenSat unit; if the jet had not been stopped by the BenSat unit, it could have had an estimated length of approximately 30 m.Off-site fire brigade teams intervened extinguishing the fire within approximately 1 hour and a half of work.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The accident was caused by the mechanical rupture of the bottom of the reciprocating compressor in the isomerisation section. This rupture was probably caused by a failure of the crank mechanism made of piston rod and drive shaft that caused the beating of the piston on the cylinder-bottom of the compressor. The combined effect of the beating and of the operation pressure may have caused the failure of the nuts holding the cylinder bottom; the following energy release threw the cylinder bottom weighing 100 kg approximately 14 meters away.Due to the fact that the process control records did not register significant changes in the process parameters it has to be assumed that the failure of the crank mechanism was caused by aspects linked to maintenance or by a material defect.At time of this report investigations were being performed on the material fragments of the failed crank components. An official systematic investigation on the failure cause with an expert appointed by the court is expected.The clearance in the compressor between piston and cylinder bottom is 3 mm. According to the declarations of the operator, it appears evident that a mechanical interference between cylinder bottom and drive shaft may have occurred.The nuts holding the failed cylinder bottom were found with completely abraded threads whereas the bolts on the contrary were practically undamaged and a few were just slightly blackened.The flammable gas mixture was probably ignited by the beating and the friction of the failed crank mechanism or by an electrostatic charge built up through gas seepage. supervision maintenance/repair component/machinery failure/malfunction",

In the isomerisation unit the loss of the compressor was registered, the compressor had practically to be completely substituted and was taken back into service in June 2003. For some months the isomerisation unit worked only with compressor K2901A. At time of this report a quantification of the repair costs was not possible.The accident could have caused more severe damage without the adoption of effective response measures and the joint effort of the on-site personnel and the off-site fire brigades; even if the on-site emergency response organisation could be improved.Affected Area: installation"

Both scenarios can be brought back to either instrumental or equipment breakdowns or to human error/action. Particularly it is believed as possible by the operations management the introduction of light mixtures or water through the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers, used for the reintroduction in the reservoir of an eventual excess of bitumen loaded by the tankers to the platforms. The initiation causes are still under characterization; based on the technical elements so far collected by the firm, the overpressure that has lead to the explosion and the projection of the TK-145 bitumen reservoir may have been triggered by the inlet of water, with consequent rapid phase transition to the 170 C hot temperature of the bitumen reservoir, higher than the boiling temperature, or by the introduction of light compounds with formation of an explosive mixture and blast, originated by the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers; the validity of such an hypothesis depends upon the results of summarizing all the operations performed in the morning of the accident. unexpected reaction/phase-transition",

The shift personnel present onsite and in particular the shift foreman who was staying on the main access ramp to the atmospheric distillation plants, testified that he saw the jet-fire ignite from the top and propagate down (from approx 18m above ground down to approx 14m in the area comprised between the exchangers E1718 A/B/C and the reactor R1702). Immediately the shift foreman activated the onsite emergency plan and informed the gate guard in order to alert the fire brigade. At 21:40 the fire brigade was alerted. The jet fire affected the quench-line with the 3 hydrogen pipe, which ruptured after 6 min. exposure with the consequent ignition of the hydrogen. The fire took a cylindrical form from the bottom to the top starting at 14 m height affecting above located plant parts, comprising under other the pre-heater of the diathermic oil. Approx 30 minutes after the fire ignited a 8 fuel pipe of the diathermic oil system ruptured and subsequent ignition of the product. The fire was kept under control and evolved without noticeable changes until consumption of the fuel once the pipes were shut off according to the emergency response plan which had been activated. The fire was extinguished at 1:20 h on 02/09/2005 (3 hours and 40 minutes after the fire initiated) and the state of emergency was called off by the fire brigade at 1:45 h.No damages to persons has been reported consequent to the accident.According to damage evaluations performed, there has not been any environmental damage, this evaluation has been confirmed also by an environmental indicators assessment performed by ARPA of Genoa.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Following the results of the investigation performed by the company and the analysis of an amateur video, the company has formulated following assumptions concerning the accident.The accident, considering the products processed, could have originated by the failure of one of the following plant components.- pipes leading to the pressure gauges of reactor R-1702- recycled gas pipe at the bottom of the reactor R-1702 having a quench function- diathermic oil pipe (hot oil) entering or exiting the exchanger- flanged joints exchanger E-1718, E-1709 and connection linesThe company excludes a release from the hot oil circuit as triggering factor of the fire, basing on the evidence gathered from the records on the pressure in the circuit which demonstrate the failure 30 min after fire start. Also the video confirms \u00f9 the pipe rupture 30 min after fire begin.For the same reason a release from the hydrogen pipes it is not considered likely, the records demonstrate that the hydrogen pipe failed 7 min after fire begin.Concerning the flange joints of exchangers E-1718, E-1719 experts requested the dismounting of the exchanger flanged joints, the joint gaskets resulted to be not damaged.For this reason the company considers the failure of a pipe from the pressure measurement gauges of reactor R-1702 as the most likely accident triggering factor, this assumption is supported by the following facts:1: this part is located in the area corresponding to the epicentre of the fire2: the area corresponds to the area visually identified by the witnesses3 the product release (hydrogen an fuel oil) from one of this pipes can cause a 6 m long jet flame as occurred.4. the product supposedly released would have had a high enough temperature and pressure to self-self-ignite or ignite against a hot spot of the plant like the hot oil circuit.5: the damages recorded are caused by overheating (flame exposition) and were not caused by overpressure or explosion- the pressure measurement records confirm significant pressure changes at the beginning of the event.The company does not have any element allowing to identify the failure cause of that pipe. vessel/container/containment-equipment failure",

        "location_description": "units:  The release of hydrocarbons, which caused the event, originated from pipeline Nr. 51 with following characteristics:- Nominal diameter 500 mm, made of carbon steel, insulated, painted with tar;- Discontinuously operated at approx. 60 C and approx 2 barg,- Transported fluids: crude oil Type BU-ATTIFEL, API Gravity 43, pourpoint 39 C. RVP 2,1 psig (as marked in the technical scheme of thetrench and as indicated in the report of the company dated 19/05/06).The pipeline connected the refinery tank DA1085 (tank farm SG10) withthe refinery topping plant CR20, the pipeline formed part of the pipebundle of 102 pipes passing inside the trench in correspondence to thecrossing of roads 8 and L, in proximity of the subway of road ex SS114. The approx. 30 mm long fissure, parallel to the pipe axis presenting a30  angle to the generating line, was detected approx. 2 m uphill fromthe subway entrance. The leakage causing the originating event couldhave been isolated uphill only by the battery limits of tank DA1085,approx. 2 km from the leak point, and downhill, some 300m from the leakpoint towards the sea, from the topping plant battery limit.Characteristics of the pipe bundle made of 102 pipes:- 63 were owned by ERG, 23 pipes were owned by Polimeri Europa, 8 pipes were owned by Syndial and 8 by DOW.- Some of these pipes were out of service (15%).- The pipe bundle was dedicated to the one\two way transfer of rawmaterials, intermediates and/or finished products (liquid hydrocarbonsand gas) and included also service lines (nitrogen, high pressure watersteam at different temperatures, industrial water, demineralised water,extinguishing water, instrument air).- The pipe bundle presenting a slight slope in the uphill section,passed through the subway made of reinforced concrete and reinforcedconcrete bottom plates.The hydrocarbon leak, which originated in the above mentioned pipeline,formed and extended pool with a length of approx. 60 m with respect tothe leak point, also due to the slight slope in that section. general pipework/flanges",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On 30/04/06 at 14:40 hrs. a plant operator noticed a spot of liquid hydrocarbons (HC) in the trench, in correspondence of the cross point of roads 8 and L, in proximity of the subway of road ex SS114 (sea side). At 15:00 hrs. The leak was localized on a pipeline section 2 m from the subway; in correspondence to road Nr. 9/0; the pipeline connected tank DA1085 in the crude oil tank-farm SG10 with the refinery's topping plant CR20 (as shown in the map included in the records).The company decided to seal the leak by installing a sealing collar on the located rupture point. The workers dismantled the piping insulation (latten and rock wool) in the corresponding pipe section. After the insulation had been dismantled the spill increased with hot hydrocarbons (60  C) spraying downwards towards the subway. The approx. 30 mm long fissure, parallel to the pipe axis presented a 30  angle generating line. A liquid hydrocarbon pool formed and spread at least up to the first detection point due to the slope inclination (some 60 m from the leakage point in the pipe).At 16:10 hrs, the competent authorities for off-site emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after conclusion of the insulation dismantling operation, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side of the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade,- isolation the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure,- closure of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade mobilised initially two emergency response vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was generated. At 17:42 hrs the shift commander of the onsite fire brigade alerted the public fire department in Siracusa, once he understood that the fire was out of control.Meanwhile the shift manager called the refinery's emergency response committee and alerted the personnel of Syndial and Polimeri Europa, owners of some of the pipe lines in the affected trench.After a few minutes another fire front developed from the entry of the subway in road Nr 9/0 (uphill), also this fire was fought initially by the onsite emergency response services, with other two fire fighting vehicles.At 18:10 hrs The public fire brigade arrived from Siracusa and took the command of the emergency response management.At 18:50 a first BLEVE explosion occurred in another pipeline line containing probably light hydro carbons, and was followed by successive explosions of pipelines in the same trench, all due to the overheating of the products inside the pipeline consequent to the heat irradiation of the fire in the trench.At 18:55 the decision was taken to shut down all installations inside the establishment, as precautionary measureFire extinguishing operations lasted 48 hours, the fire damaged seriously the pipelines uphill and downhill the subway, as well as aerial pipelines passing parallel to the trench or crossing it. Further limited damage occurred to the subway.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The causes of the accident are of technical nature:- concerning the causes of the leak, it has been determined that the pipe was perforated due to corrosion processes which occurred externally on the pipe surface; as stated in the technical consultancy report of TUV Italia S.R.L (Italian branch of the German Product Certification Organization), prepared on request of the Attorney General's Office of Siracusa (reportr Nr. 165145/06 dated 16.09.06) and deposited on 16/11/2006).- The above mentioned report states in the conclusion ns of the report: basing on the results obtained it appears evident that the fissure formed in the pipe is the result of a localised corrosion process (rust), affecting the external pipe surface, consuming the pipe wall until perforation.The same document states: It is likely that the localisation of the fissure, with respect to the point where it formed, is linked to one or more of the following factors:- localized damage in the original pipe coating- material defect in the original pipe coating- critical operative conditions (of the pipe section in which the fissure occurred) linked to the placement of the pipe near the ground and its exposition to atmospheric events (sea air).The company agrees with this hypothesis on pipe corrosion: The company declares that the pipe was periodically inspected, in compliance with technical norms API 570 piping inspection code, these inspections were formed part of the establishment maintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection of the pipeline had been performed in February 2005.Concerning this aspect, the technical consultancy report states at page 140 (answer to question Nr. 1 of the Attorney General; that in principle it is not possible to affirm that the maintenance of the pipe in question was insufficient, but it is pointed out that the pipeline examined had been built more than 40 years ago, and was bought from AGIP Petroli Spa in 2002, AGIP did not provide the technical documentation on maintenance operations on the piping bundle prior to the sale. This circumstance has not allowed, according to the technical consultancy report, to verify the compliance with the technical norms on visual tests, inspections and maintenance of the piping system concerned.Concerning the cause of the fire, the company made the supposition that, , the contact between the vapours formed from the spilled hydrocarbons with hot spots of high pressure steam pipes, reaching up to 280  steam temperature, in correspondence of the subway, may have contributed to the expansion of a vapour cloud; the vapour cloud ignited on an ignition source downhill from the subway were the first fire was detected.Concerning the successive BLEVEs, which caused major damage to the persons involved in the emergency response operations, these are related directly to the permanent heat irradiation of the fire (which lasted approx. 48 hrs), which overheated other pipelines containing hydrocarbons also in gas form in the pipe string. Concerning the direct involvement of the company, the same company states that the event may have had less serious consequences if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted immediately at leak detection and not three hours later, as effectively happened.This assumption is confirmed by the technical consultancy report, which affirms that if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted more rapidly the damages caused by the fire could have been contained.Concerning this aspect it has to be said that the Attorney General's Office is still investigating on the matter.The Human error indicated relates to the faulty application of the Emergency procedures foreseen in the onsite Emergency Plan.The fault during the Repair operation (dismantling of the pipe insulation layer) relates to the failure to adopt appropriate safety measures during the operation.The design fault relates to the inadequate design and rationalisation of the pipe bundle. training/instruction design of plant/equipment/system maintenance/repair corrosion/fatigue operator error",

The bottom of the containment basin is constituted by native ground covered by sand and inert materials. The foundation of the tank is made of several compacted layers with different granulometrty and a bitumen coping. Inside the basin drainage is assured by a water drainage system collecting all rain water and other liquidsin from the bottom of the basin.Following the main maintenance operations on the tank T-2003 are listed. - In 1984 the programmed 20-year internal inspection was performed, the inspection showed the thickness reduction of the bottom tank plates in consequence of the test results 60 % of the bottom tank plate were substituted - In 1985 .an external shell inspection showed leakage of crud oil in correspondence of one of the mixers, with consequent shut-down for maintenance. The maintenance report mentions controls on the internal bottom welding (vacuum technique) not showing any anomalies, as precautionary measure the lower bottom of the tank and the lower tank shell plates were sand blasted and painted with protective varnish.- Successive external inspections (1994,1997, 2001) showed a generally good condition of the tank.- In 2003 a secondary roof tank gasket was installed.- In 2004 the results of an test using acoustic emissions suggested the need to repeat the same test after 2 years.In 2005 an external inspection showed oxidation processes on the outer shell surface, a degradation by oxidation of the protective varnish of the tank shell and minor damages to the tank top curb protective varnish, while on the tank roof panels water and deterioration of the protective varnish was detected,For this tank it was already planned to substitute the panels of the floating roof and the installation of a double tank bottom, these activities were programmed to start in may 2007 and to be completed in march 2008 container; non-pressurised (hopper, tank, drum, bag, etc.)",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On 1/05/2006 at 18:00 a crude oil leak was detected in the bottom part of the shell of the floating roof tank T-3002.Approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t were released into the unpaved retention basin of 130m x 108m = 14.042 m2 and with a equivalent volume capacity as the tank.The characteristics of the released product are: Bashrah type crude oil Physical-chemical characteristics:Density (15 C) 858 kg/m3Viscosity (20 C) 11cstFlash point: &lt;21 CComposition: H2S &lt; 0.001% weightComments: The accident has been classified as major accident in reason of the amount of product released &gt;5% quantity for category 08 - extremely flammable as defined at point 1 of legislative decree 334/99 and subsequent amendments - released amount approx. 26.000 t.The event was triggered by the failure of tank T-3002 in correspondence of the lower shell part of the same tank.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: the wind caused difficulties inside the retention basinto keep the surface of the spilled oil covered with foam Wind speed: 2.00, Wind direction: Est-Nord-Est, Temperature: 18.00Discussion about Occurrence:At 18:00 hrs on 1/05/2006 alarm was triggered due to smell perception and to the tank level alarm triggered at a variation of &gt;5 cm in the transfer control room; the alarm was caused by a release of crude oil in the storage area south east of the establishment, controls established a relevant leakage of crude oil in the inferior part of the floating roof tank T-3002.The onsite emergency plan specific for the storage area of the installation was triggered. The other production units of the installation did not shut down, because general emergency was not declared, .The tank was insulated from the other systems of the installation by shutting down all electrical systems.The onsite fire brigade intervened, composed by two fire fighters and 1 company's employees (standard composition of the team during week ends) and was promptly integrated by other 8 trained workers.The plant operators provided to transfer of remaining product in the tank T-3002 into tanks T-3001 and T-3004 with fixed pumps. At the same time the onsite fire brigade started to spray foaming agentst inside of the containment basin with the onsite fire extinguishing equipment, such to cover constantly the surface of the still leaking product.At 18:00 hrs the company official in charge as onsite emergency manager informed the provincial command of the fire brigade in Taranto which intervened with own equipment.The transfer of the spilled oil, which was continuosly leaking from the tank, was p\u00e8erformed with of four mobile pumps, and was kept under constant control by the onsite fire brigade and the public fire brigade of Taranto. The public fire brigade of Taranto kept on spraying discontinuously the surface of the released product with foaming agents in order to maintain it constantly covered.Several teams of the public fire brigade intervened until 19:00 hrs of 05/05/2006 when the product released was completely pumped off from the containment basin.The large amount of spilled product caused difficulties in the product transfer process, due to the fact that the release rate of the spilling product was much higher than the capacity the fixed pumps, therefore the level of spilled products was increasing constantly.Maintaining a constant foam level on the spilled product, in order to avoid formation of explosive/flammabnle air/product mixtures, was very difficult due to the fact, that the basin surface was very large and that the leaking liquid was causing a strong turbulence associated with the wind. It was feared that the leaking product could overflow the dams o the containment basin (having an equivalent volume to the damaged tank) due to the amounts of foam sprayed on the crude oil surface.Two road tankers and 8 trailers of high and medium expanding foam were used.The provincial fire brigade intervened with 4 vehicles and 26 men. Vapour concentrations of the spilled oil were continuously monitored on top of the containment basin dam, during the transfer operation of the spilled crude oil The concentration levels determined during the monitoring variated from 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.The railway lines Taranto - Bari, Taranto- Metaponto were closed down as a precautionary measure until 5:30 hrs. on 2/05/2006.The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.The area affected by the spillage was put under continuous surveillance by the onsite fire fighting team and by the public fire brigade of Taranto. Several teams of the public fire brigade have been intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operations of the containment basin terminated.The failure of tank T-3002 has caused the release of approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t.At the date of this report the environmental impact on the soil of the containment basin has been analysed whereas soil remediation measures had were to be taken for the containment basin.

The personnel present onsite during holydays consists in the average in 40 units.Ecological Harm - Remarks:The release of crude oil inside the containment basin has caused soil contamination in the basin. Sample probes have showed principally concentrations of heavy hydrocarbons (C&gt;12) and to an minor extends concentrations of light hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds (C&lt;12) above the contamination threshold limits. At a maximal depth of 2m.The stratigraphy of the soil in the basin has shown that at approx. 3 m depth starts a clay layer reaching 80 m depth (data extracted from the regional geologic map) which has a low permeability isolating thus the deep water bed from the superficial water bed which starts at 2,5 m from the surface.The piezometric probes have shown pollution levels in the superficial water bed above the threshold values defined by law but, according to the statements of the company, these values have not changed significantly with respect to the values encountered in the soil classification performed in 2004.The results of the soil classification have been used in the Environmental and -Health Risk Analysis which was performed and has shown an unacceptable risk at such concentration level and therefore the need of remediation measures. The company is waiting the validation by the Ministry of Environment of the results obtained in the Risk Analysis such to set up a remediation project. Meanwhile, due to the fact that that part of the contaminants in the contaminated soil are washed out by precipitation and thus reach the water shed, a permanent piezometric monitoring system of the water shed through a series of wells placed hydro-geologically upstream and downstream from the tank T-3002. In any case the watershed Remediation project for the entire refinery which has been authorised in 2004 foresaw the construction of a hydraulic barrier in correspondence of tank T-3002, which has been realised. The hydraulic barrier consists in a series of pozzi di emungimento (injection wells) from which the water from the superficial water shed can be pumped for treatment.Material Loss - Remarks:The company had following costs:- Emergency response action (rental of motorised pumps, medium and high expanding foaming agent and other consumables);- Temporary repair of the tank by constructing a retention wall of approx 2 m of steel reinforced concrete in correspondence to the leakage point.- The contaminated soil analysis and the Risk Analysis specific for the occurrenceThe numbers indicated comprise also the estimated cost for:Tank cleaning, opening, repair and retrofitting (installation of a double bottom)Contaminated soil remediation inside the retention basin.Community Disruption - Remarks:The railway lines Taranto - Bari and Taranto- Metaponto which pass respectively at 80 and 165m from the western limit of the retention basin, were closed down as a precautionary measure The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentConsequences - Ecological harm - pollution/contamination/damage of: Ecological component: land (with known potential for long term ecological harm or preventing human access or activities) - Affected Yes"

In principle the flow meter should have registered the real amount of VCM released, due to the fact that when the accident occurred there was no charge process of the reactors of line B undergoing, and no deviation of product to other equipment was found.The integration of the data registered by flow meter FI900 indicate (annex 7) that approx. 4000 kg of -VCM passed through the mass flow meter during a period of approx. 10 minutes.The operator affirms (annex 5 pp15-16) that the flow registered by the instrument is not corresponding to the real one.Concerning the potential quantity of 7200 kg it is derived from the top event Release of VCM from the transfer line to valve FV-9000 (Annex 8). This accident scenario has been set up exactly in the line where the accidental release actually occurred on 06/07/2006 ",

If VCM in liquid state is released into the atmosphere, , the VCM partly vaporises a cloud which can cause cold burns on the skin because its boiling point -13  C.According to the declaration of the operator (pag.5 annex 5) when the accident occurred the polymerisation reactors were in the following operative stateLine A Line BReactor Nr. state Reactor Nr. state1 Processing 7 Processing2 Processing 8 anti-contamination treatment3 Processing 9 Processing4 Processing 10 Processing5 Processing 11 Heating6 Charged with CVM 12 Waiting to be emptied13 Processing 14 ProcessingAccordino to environmental monitoring system made by VCM detectors (annex 4) at 7.51.38 sensor Nr. 30, positioned near the reactors 7 and 8, detected the presence of VCM, indicating a value of &gt; 100 ppm (upper measurement limit). It is observed that detector Nr. 36, located a few metres from the release point, did not detect any VCM at 7.50.17, it is concluded therefore that the CSM release occurred between 7.50.17 hrs and 7.51.38 hrs.The shift assistant was informed immediately over the phone by the personnel in the control room, that the sensor system indicated the presence of VCM onsite, he came directly into the control room. Also the operative assistant came into the control room, after he was informed via intercommunication system and had ordered the entire personnel to go to the emergency gathering points, as foreseen by the onsite emergency response plan.The external reactor assistant, equipped with self-respirator and a portable VCM-meter went to check the detector which triggered alarm. Successively also the shift foreman went to the release area equipped with self-respirator and reached the filter P24123/B almost contemporarily with the external assistant, there they both noticed that the filter was releasing two phase VCM from the flanged coupling in correspondence of the filter head.Following the most relevant actions undertaken by the workers to isolate the VCM leakage from the filter are listed.- The shift assistant closed the manually operated valve located upstream to the filter;- the plant maintenance assistant opened 2 gas relief valves to the gas flare and to the abatement system.- the operation assistant closed the manual valve located downstream to the filter, concluding the isolation operation of the filter.- the switchboard assistant closed the remotely operated valves XV24121 and XV121G located on the VCM feed manifold of reactors on line B, as shown in the technical operating scheme PM 33640 of the VCM feeding process - the switchboard operator successively depressurised the flare line such to transfer the VCM contained in the isolated line to the abatement system- the shift assistant, the process assistant, the plant assistant and the plant maintenance assistant checked that the leak of VCM was originated from the flanged coupling of the filter head, and tried to tighten the filter head bolts without obtaining an appreciable result.- the plant maintenance assistant , assisted by three department maintenance assistants opened the filter , extracted the candle filter package, mounted a new filter holding plate without candle filters and new sealing gaskets, after receiving the authorisation from the department manager.- the above described operations were executed in different moments: The plant workers started to spray the release area with water after the valve downstream of the filter had been closed..- the Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site was triggered and the day shift workers arriving to the establishment were blocked at the establishment entrance or directed to the emergency gathering points.- the fire brigade teams of Servizi Porto Marghera intervened and set up water curtains to abate the VCM in the affected department area.The Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site sent three messages concerning the evolution of the event.Time of the message8.17 PIE team in CV24 to check VCM release from the coupled flange of filter to reactors8.18 CV24: release stopped, circuit aspiring, teams assisting8.34 CV24: event ended, plant in safe condition False False False False gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air",

VCM is maintained in liquid state by applying a higher pressure than ambient pressure. If VCM in liquid state is released into the atmosphere, because its boiling point is -13 C, the VCM partly vaporises into a cloud which can cause cold burns on the skin.During the emergency response operation, while the worker was trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, the worker suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of the hand while opening the valve of the gas release system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. The accident did not cause any off-site consequences.Area concerned:The environmental monitoring system of department CV24-25 is equipped with 52 gas sampling probes, the system analyses the presence of VCM (vinyl chloride monomer), ECF (ethyl chloroformate) and DCE (di-chloro-ethane), this has allowed to detect the VCM release in the area affected and the evolution of the VCM concentrations.The streams extracted by each sampling probe is sent to a mass spectrograph to determine the concentrations, the systems allows to detect concentrations from 0 to 100 ppm.The VCM monitoring is performed each 17 minutes, between each extraction of air samples by the sampling probes and the successive extraction, the analysis sequence is not numeric. The VCM release point is located inside a shed with three walls, partially opened to the exterior. The filter is located on a second floor some 8-10 m from the ground. On the ground floor are located polymerisation lines A and B constituted by a total of 14 reactors.The records of the values measured by each probe the day of the event (annex 4), show that during an extended period of time inside the shed. VCM concentrations reached values of more than 100 ppm (above the measurement limit of the instruments), probably due to the fact that the shed is only partially opened.In the polymerisation area a value above instrument measurement limit was measured at 7.51.38 by probe 30 (bottom of reactors 7 and 8) while probe Nr. 19 (comb of reactor 14) measured values above 100 ppm. also after 9.30 hrs. Probe Nr. 36 located near the release point registered VCM concentrations in the air above 100 ppm. Untill approx. 10.15. After that hour there are no records of VCM concentrations measured by the probes above 100 ppm.Also outside the polymerisation area there are some probes which registered VCM concentrations above 100 ppm: in particular probes 6 and 63 registered concentration peaks of VCM respectively at 8.15.14 and 8.09.06 in correspondence of road F located south- west from the release point, the measured values descended to 10 ppm respectively at 8.49.59 and 8.27.00.The probe located the farthest from the release point measured relevant concentrations of VCM, probe Nr. 61, located in correspondence to the gasholder some 120 m from the release point, measured a VCM concentration of 74.34 ppm. at 8.07.47 hrs, while the foregoing measurement and the successive one registered just CVM concentrations below 1 ppm.Also probe Nr. 44 inside the control room detected a VCM concentration of 93.28 ppm at 8.11.42 and then progressively decreasing values until values below 1 ppm.Ineos Vinyl has employed a mobile vehicle to monitor the VCM concentrations in the areas outside of the departments (annex 5 page 20)The mobile vehicle performed 28 progressive measurements at 12 minutes interval in relation to 9 different positions, of which 8 were inside a perimeter of 500 metres from the department and one measurement point was located between 00 and 1000 m from the department. The values measured by the mobile vehicle were in the range of a few ppm while inside the department the values measured were above 100 ppm.The position nearest to the city, monitored by the mobile vehicle, was position Nr. 7, the values were of 0,19 ppm and 0,8 ppm measured respectively at 11.34 and 11.46.People - Remarks:When the event occurred the shift personnel present insite was composed by:Shift personnel Position1 shift assistant in the office building3 switchboard operators in the control room1 external reactor operator in the control room1 external services operator in the control room1 external drying process operator in the office of the shift assistantThe day shift personnel starts work at 8:00 hrs.

Self protective equipment with facial mask and specific AX filter or ABEK filter (annex 5 page 7)The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM release made by Doct. Tommaso A. Dragani in which it is stated that: The VCM release on 6/07/2006 never constituted a health hazard.During the emergency response operation a worker, while trying to isolate the failed filter by closing a manual valve downhill of the filter, suffered a slight cold burn on his forearm caused by the contact with the handle of the manually operated valve, which was covered with ice due to the VCM release. The worker went to the onsite sanitary service for medical attention after alarm was called off.During emergency operations, another worker suffered from a temporary sensitisation of one hand while opening the valve of the gas relief system, the symptoms disappeared without any medical treatment. There are no known offsite consequences to persons or known offsite material damage.Ecological Harm - Remarks:On 06/07/2006 at 14.07 hrs a water samples were taken from the sewage water discharged into the public sewage system at point SM2. The analysis made by the Societa Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) indicates a concentration of 22,4 g/l of VCM, with respect to the threshold limit of 50 g/l.Test report 2006/5852 on a former test sample taken at 8:20 indicates a VCM concentration of 3.1 g/l."

The reaction was carried out without ad adequate addition of ammonia and therefore the normal small hydrogen chloride production could not be compensated. Hence, the excess of hydrogen chloride destabilized the suspension of PVC-latex which coagulated. The coagulation of the latex caused the mixer failure but there was no indication of it. Consequently, a local overheating resulted and a decomposition on PVC occurred because the steam temperature (165-175 C) was higher that the PVC decomposition temperature (144 C). Being the PVC decomposition exothermic, the heat caused an expansion of coagulated latex clogged all the pipings including the inlet to the bursting disc and to the safety valve. The uncompensated hydrogen chloride started to react with the material of the reactor (the Duplex stainless steel was not resistant against hydrogen chloride at high temperatures). Though the steam supply had been stopped and the external cooling started (activated by the release of hot gases from the reactor), the vessel burst because the wall thickness was reduced from 9.8 mm to 2 mm.

The substance they were sponging was an impregnating solution constituted principally of n-butylacetate and 2-propanol.The leakage is likely to have been detected before the breakfast pause, because the two mixer operators declared that they had closed the drain-cock of the feed-tank before the breakfast pause.

Cooling of the neighbouring tanks by means of their water-cooling rings and additional portable/mobile fire fighting equipment employed by the fire brigade was started to prevent escalation. The tank was left to burn until adequate foam concentrate and water pumping capacity were available to undertake a successful foam attack using monitors (a second foam unit was on stand-by to fight pitfires should a boil-over occurred).

It took about 8 minutes to inform the Police Alarm Centre via the CIN.The chlorine went underneath the chlorine detection system which was located at the height of 3 metres.

The vessel had to be cleaned with water because of problems in the normal process. The vessel was situated at a level of about 60 feet high. In order to ad water to the vessel the pipeline was used. At ground level the pipe was disconnected and a cast iron Saunders valve was attached. The fire water system was attached to the Saunders valve. Not very well known was the fact that in the pipeline were quantities of AlCl3 and TiCl4 as a deposit. The water and the deposit caused rapid reactions. The rapid pressure rise had the force of an explosion, but the pressure itself did not exceed the burst pressure of the pipe. This is proved because of the fact that longitudinal cracks did not develop. The fast pressure was transmitted in all directions. As mentioned before the pipe resisted the pressure in circumferential and of course also in longitudinal directions. But the pressure (probably a pressure wave) was directly transmitted through the water to the end, where the Saunders valve was situated, in almost completely closed position. The pressure wave resulted in a brittle failure of the Saunders valve housing. As a result of the thrust of the water and the vapour, expelled at a high speed, induces strong reaction forces on the pipe, resulting in a pipe whip and so destroying the pipeline in several parts.The loosening of the pipe end and the vertical ends of the pipeline in which water was able to form a kind of blockage, may have played a role in the accident. Also important is that probably the single reaction between water and TiCl4 at itself was not enough to be the cause of the accident. It was the combination of reactions between water and TiCl4 and AlCl3 that caused the problem. The reaction between AlCl3 and water is exothermic, and sped up the pressure rise. management organization inadequate organized procedures process analysis design of plant/equipment/system vessel/container/containment-equipment failure",

The fire jumped across to other storage rooms and eventually caused a mass explosion of the stored fireworks.The process of escalation that lead to the disaster started in the repackaging area C2. The cause of the initial fire in this area has not been clarified. Suggested causes are: arson, auto-ignition of a so-called flash-cord, short circuiting of an improvised electricity conduit in C2 or the (illegal) handling/using of fireworks on May 13. The fire was not noticed until external effects occurred. When the fire brigade arrived at the scene, the fire had probably been going on for at least 25 minutes. By that time several fires had started in the area, caused by ejected fireworks. At a certain point in time, a fire started in a triangle between two containers and the concrete fencing of the site. Even after the fire in C2 was brought under control, smoke and later flames and ignited fireworks were detected from the adjacent bunker C4. A suggested scenario how the fire spread to this bunker is that it passed through the 7 centimeter diameter water-pipe lead-through in the wall between C2 and C4. Consequently, the fire brigade detected the fire in the triangle between the two containers (E2 and E15) and the concrete fence. Attempts to extinguish this fire were complicated by the inaccessability of the triangle. At this moment the fire had probably already spread to the contents of container E2. This may be concluded from the fact that shortly after the fire brigade had started extinguishing the fire in the triangle, they observed signs of fire in container E2. Shortly afterwards, container E2 exploded. This explosion caused a large flame in the direction of the central storage. However, this has probably not been the main factor in the following escalation. Ejected heavy fireworks from E2 exploded in front of the MAVO boxes, probably struck through the doors of these boxes and ignited its contents. Within one minute after the explosion of container E2, the MAVO boxes exploded rapidly one by one, starting with M7. This mass explosion is probably mainly due to the heavy class of the fireworks, in combination with the small dampening between the MAVO boxes. M7 probably contained fireworks of class 1.1. Its explosion had a TNT equivalent of circa 800 kg and was accompanied by a shock wave and a fire ball of 85 meters in diameter. Little more than a minute after the explosion of the MAVO boxes the final explosion took place, destroying bunker C11 and the rest of the bunker complex. The remaining containers exploded almost simultaneously. It is assumed that the ejected fireworks from the explosion of the MAVO boxes and/or the fireball initiated the explosion in C11. The doors of the bunkers had probably been destroyed by the previous explosion. The explosion of the other bunkers of the central storage was either initiated by ejected fireworks, or by the heat from the explosion in C11. The time interval between the explosions of the separate bunkers was so small that they were perceived as one. This final explosion had a TNT-equivalent of about 4 to 5 tonnes.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The company did not meet many of its legal obligations. The company stored more fireworks than it had obtained permits for, and the majority of these fireworks were of a much heavier class than was permitted. Fireworks were present in the repackaging area where the fire first started, in which area no fireworks were permitted to be present when no work was being performed, as was the case on May 13. The water-pipe lead-through between the repackaging area and the adjacent bunker C4 was of a nature which allowed fire to jump across. Two containers with no permits had been added in 1999, one of these two containers (E15) formed a side of the triangle in which fireworks ejected from the repackaging area and/or the adjacent bunker started a fire. That triangle was, due to the way in which this container had been positioned, nearly closed off and difficult to access. The part of the terrain in this triangle had not been kept sufficiently clean to prevent the fire from spreading. management organization inadequate management attitude problem design of plant/equipment/system Yes",

It is therefore assumed that environment and public health have not been endangered by exposure to dangerous substances after the explosion.National heritage loss - Remarks: National Museum Twenthe was damaged.Material loss - Remarks: Total material costs are estimated to be at least 1.000.000.000 guilders. 1250 persons have lost their houses. A number of them also lost all of their possessions. About 10,000 people were forced to spend at least one night elsewhere.Disruption of community life: Communication networks were overheated for several hours after the explosion. 400 houses are demolished or severely damaged. The community isdisrupted. It is assumable that heavy metals from the fireworks havecome into the environment.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local"

After smoke detection, the automatic fire extinguisher was activated. During the filling of the hall with foam, it was discovered that some ventilation hatches were still open. Two of three hatches were kicked shut, but then the increasing amount of foam prevented further action. Consequently the hall was filled with foam and automatically refilled whenever the foam level dropped. Refilling continued from 05.16 until 05.57, then the installation ran out of foam. New supplies arrived too late, around 08.00. At this point the foam level had probably dropped to a level allowing oxygen to come into contact with the smouldering waste. The fire brigade had to wait for the automatic system to extinguish the fire. When it became apparent that this did not happen, they could not enter the hall.

Toxic combustion products were formed.The smoke of the fire covered a large area west of Drachten. At first it was feared that the smoke contained a lot of toxic substances. Therefor the Ministry of Agriculture took precautionary measures. The concentration of toxic materials in the water, soil and grass was measured. Milk from cows in the area was destroyed.People - Remarks:39 employees of ATF were examined to detect possible adverse effects on their health. The overall conclusion of the examination was favourable. Some employees reported irritation of the airway one day after the fire. Social life was influenced to some extent, due to overwork. Biometric tests did not show abnormalities due to exposure to toxic substances. One of the companies involved in the clean-up operation also had its employees examined. No adverse effects on health were registered. Furthermore, monitoring of levels of toxic substances in the area around the site (both air and soil) showed that no one was exposed to significant levels of dioxins during or after the fire.Material Loss - Remarks:The farmers affected by the preventive measures receive a total of 500,000 Euros for compensation of their expenses and losses.Discussion about consequences:Initial testing indicated elevated levels of lead and cadmium up till 4 kilometres from the fire. At a distance of 300 metres the cadmium levels in the grass exceeded about ten times the allowed maximum levels for cattle-fodder. In the week after the fire grass and milk samples were taken again to examine the nature, concentration levels and possible risks of the combustion products that were released during the fire. The results of this investigation may be summarized as follows:|\u00b7 As a result of the preventive measures taken, no elevated levels of heavy metals, PCB's and dioxins were expected in milk from the area. Measurements on milk samples collected on May 13, 14 and 15 confirmed these assumptions.|\u00b7 Grass samples taken in the area 1.5 till 30 kilometres from the fire showed no elevated levels of PCB's, dioxin-like substances or heavy metals.|\u00b7 Elevated levels of dioxin were found only in grass at distances less than 1500 metres from the fire.|\u00b7 At one of the 49 measure sites, at a distance of 1 kilometre from the fire, elevated levels of vanadium, chrome, arsene, cadmium, mercury and lead were measured in the grass. The allowed maximum level in cattle-fodder was exceeded only for lead on this site. No other samples in the area 0,5 till 30 kilometres from the fire showed excess of the allowed maximum levels for heavy metals in cattle-fodder.Affected Area: installationAffected Area: establishmentAffected Area: off-site: local"

        "causes_description": "causes:  Human cause, unclear markings caused confusion on whether the valve was open or shut.A temporary employee, who had only been working in the company since a short period of time, first of all CLOSED the valve under supervision of his mentor. After a while the temporary employee returned without his mentor. Since he had doubts if the valve was really closed he turned it a second time. At that time he thought he closed it, but in fact with this action he OPENED valve again activating the alarm. He then decided to turn the valve a third time. Now the valve was CLOSED. What he did not know was that there is always a (minor) delay in the decrease of pressure in the pipeline because of which the alarm bells continue to go off for a short time.Some background information: The pipeline is some hundred meters long and there is still some pressure on the pipe immediately after changes in the valves. In other words there is always a certain delay when closing the pipe due to which the pressure appears high in a small part of the pipeline. One has to take this delay into account.He then asked for assistance of the mentor. (The mentor had not been present when the temporary employee had opened and closed the valve a couple of times.) They decided to turn the valve a fourth time thinking it would close it, but actually OPENING it. And -most importantly- they turned off the alarm. Not taking into account the alarm had only went off because of the delay in the pipe line. To sum up, the status of the valve when they left was 'OPEN' and the alarm bells did NOT go off since they had been turned off. Why did this confusion about opening or closing the valve occur? Two years prior to this accident a similar accident had happened. The correction that was applied after that accident was the following: a warning sign with the word 'OPEN' was placed over the valve (in other words it covered the valve). However, in a closed situation the warning sign showed the word 'open' and in an open situation the sign showed the word 'open' as well. The only difference was that in an open situation the word 'open' was read vertically and in a closed situation horizontally. Hence, the improvement/correction that was made due to the accident that had happened 2 years before caused even more confusion for someone that did not know the practical reason behind it. This 'opening and closing' should have been noticed in BP's control room, but did not result in any action since the alarm had been turned off (see above). organized procedures not known / not applicable operator error not known / not applicable",

The contents of the document remained known only to them. The document contained the pumping flow rate (ca. 500 m#/h), the volume of water to be purged (2900m#), the time estimated for purging the pipeline (ca. 6h), the frequency of supervisions of the system (in the first three hours not less than three times an hour; starting from the fourth hour continuous monitoring until conclusion of the purging), the circumstances for which the sewage treatment plant of the refinery would have to be contacted as well as the conditions under which the pumping operations would have to be stopped.On 14/10/98 at about 20:30 h the deputy captain of the ship Enalios Tethis signed a discharge protocol, named Operation Agreement &amp; Sequence Agreement, according to the parameters agreed upon with the Product Handling department, without making any reservation from the part of the tanker concerning the assurance of minimal flow-rate of 500 m#/h .Once the unloading started, the CLT informed the Product Handling control room that according to the information given by the ship, the pumping flow-rate corresponded to 300 m#/h.The assistant manager of the Logistics department requested around 21:05 from- CLT an increase of the flow rate to 500 m#/h. He again requested the control room to confirm jointly with the CLT the flow rate, because the level in the channel was already reaching half level.Around 21:15 the manager of the Product Handling Department communicated to the operator of the waste water treatment plant that the water which was being purged was clean, so that drain 25 (rainwater) could be diverted from the storm-water basin to the sea, an operation which was performed.Around 21:20 the ship informed CLT that pumping was being carried out with a flow rate of 500m#/h , information which was transmitted to the control room of the Product Handling department.Around 21:40 the assistant manager of the Logistics department requested an increase of the pumping flow rate of further 100 m3/h, having observed that in the purging zone (zona di spurgo) the water remained clean and that the level in the channel had increased to near to reach its maximum level; he also requested the CLT to confirm the flow rate. Around 21:45 the deputy captain of the ship informed that the pumping was being carried out at a flow rate of 650 m#/h. After having established that the channel could not contain a higher flow rate, the assistant manager of the logistics department requested not to increase the flow rate any more and, in case of any variation, to reduce it. Instructions were issued to the ship not to exceed a flow rate of 700 m#/h.During shift change at 22:00, the operation coordinator was informed about the situation and it was particularly recommended to him that if traces of oil appeared, to request U 7000 (on-site waste water treatment plant) to divert drain 25 to the storm water basins, and after 24:00 to divert the drain to the storm water basin in any case even if no oil spot appeared.The operator of the waste water treatment plant declared that at 22:30 he saw traces of hydrocarbons in the water flowing in the outlet box of drain 25 towards the rainwater drain; he then went to the storm water basins to ascertain the situation. Around 22:40, he alerted by phone the control room of the Product Handling department and started the operations for diverting drain 25 from the rain water drain to the storm water basin of the waste water treatment plant. Meanwhile, the operator of the Security Service passing near the control room was requested to check what was occurring in drain 25.At 22:45 the release of crude oil by drainage system 25 occurred.In consideration of this situation, it was ordered to divert drain 25 towards the storm water basin and to contact CLT to stop the pumping from the ship.At approx. 22:50 the operator of the waste water treatment plant performed the diverting operation of drain 25 from the rain water drain towards then storm water basins, but due to the high flow rate a part of the effluent was still discharged to the sea. It has not been determined if the operator acted following a specific order from the control room of the Product Handling department or if he acted on his own independent initiative. The operator declared that he acted on his own initiative. The Product Handling department declared on its side that a specific request had been issued.Around 23:05, the Product Handling department requested CLT to interrupt the pumping, which was carried out. The Product Handling department informed CLT that the deputy captain had communicated that until 23:00 2900 m3 had been discharged.Around 23:15 general alarm was released while the fire which had deflagrated on the beach of Aterro propagated through the rain water outfall to the rain water outlet box inside, the refinery .The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45.

The layer, at the region around the opening, is about 40 cm. The water remaining in the material should be released during the hardening process. The supplier adds fibres of steel or plastic to reinforce and to build canals to allow the water to leave the castings. In this case the supplier added metallic aluminium (Al) which together with alkaline water forms hydrogen gas, which intentionally forms canals to let the water out of the castings. The supplier was conscious of the formation of hydrogen gas but had not informed the company about it.The supplier need not, in the safety data sheet (SDS), mention that the product contains metallic aluminium, if the content is less than 1%.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  This accident is being reported under the provisions of part II of appendix VI on specific technical interest.A cistern containing 16,300 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid was ruptured. The entire contents of the cistern was spilled out into the tank bund and then out into Kemira Kemi AB's (KKAB) dock. When the sulphuric acid came into contact with the water there was an exothermic reaction, which produced a vapour cloud that drifted northwards along the coastline with the wind. After the spill there was approximately 2,000 tons of contaminated sulphuric acid by water in the bund. About 100,000 sq.m. of the ground surrounding the spill has been affected by the acid. An acid cloud was produced when the sulphuric acid came into contact with the salt water in the bund. The salt water consisted of approx. 0.7 w-% chloride ions. The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) has estimated that the sulphuric acid together with the salt water produced a cloud (gas and aerosol) consisting of hydrogen chloride (HCl). During the first few minutes the maximum concentration of HCl was estimated at 6 000 mg/m3 at some spots near the scene of the accident. After 10 min the highest concentration was 600 mg/m3 and the concentration declined to 60 mg/m3 after 60 min. Fortunately the cloud moved along the coast line and mostly over the sea. No one outside the plant was affected.The cistern stands in a tank farm and the bund can hold a third of a cistern's volume in the event of a leak. The bund was filled with salt water when the rupture occurred. There was also another cistern containing 19,500 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid in the bund. To reduce the risk of damage to this other cistern the incident commander ordered the emptying of the bund, resulting in 1,000 to 2,000 tons of water contaminated by sulphuric acid being pumped out into the company's dock area.Meteorological conditions:The acid cloud (gas and aerosol) moved along the coastline but mostly over the sea. After approx. one hour and approx. 10 km away from the plant the acid concentration in the cloud was harmless.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The cause of this incident has been assessed to be a leak in a coolant supply pipe, which caused a weakening of the ground under the tank farm. This led to instability in the cistern, which subsequently split. The dyking was also damaged. Progress of events 4.2.2005:03.35 hours: the alarm raised about low pressure in the coolant supply pipe, which instigated the starting up of another coolant supply pump in order to maintain supply to the works. 03.45: water seen in the dyking coming from a hole east of the cistern inside the dyking.04.10: the water starts to run out over the dyking.04.36: The cistern split and 16, 300 tons of sulphuric acid emptied from the cistern in effect instantaneously. A high acid wave was seen moving towards the dock. Personnel in the docks area, 8 people (5 KKAB employees and 3 from Helsingborg's port), ran in different directions to reach safety. 5104 - corrosion/fatigueThe primary cause of the incident was the leak in the coolant supply pipe. The pipe is made of concrete and came into use during the first half of the 1960s, most likely 1963. The pipe had been in use through the years without any major problems ever having been identified. The only damage noted to the pipe was a leak at the pumping station in 1999.An inspection of the failed pipe after the incident detected little or no internal corrosion, but heavy external corrosion to the concrete. In certain places on the pipe the concrete has corroded so severely that the reinforcing steel has been exposed. The appearance of that part of the coolant supply pipe that was studied suggests that the corrosion is as a result of an acidic attack on the concrete. According to a German DIN standard (1991) DIN 4030 and a European standard EN 260 (2001) a strong attack on concrete occurs if the pH level in surrounding water is &lt; 5.5 and a very strong attack is if the pH level is &lt;4.5.In 1989 a ground pollution study was carried out in the area, during which one of the sample taking points was close to the failed coolant supply pipe. At this point the pH level was measured at approx. 4 in the shallow groundwater. With this new knowledge gained the company drew the conclusion that this pH level entailed risks for strong acidic attacks on the concrete. The same conditions apply to the risk of a sulphate attack in the pipe. not known / not applicable vessel/container/containment-equipment failure corrosion/fatigue",
        "consequences_description": "consequences:  Other - 8 minor injuries Other - Extensive studies carried out, see details above other - 7,000 inhabitants were advised to stay indoors etc for several hours Consequences for humansSulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid are extremely corrosive and can in mist form cause severe irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Eight persons who worked at the plant were taken to hospital for check ups, but were able to go home later that day, after they'd been examined.Because of the way the acid cloud moved no one off-site was affected by the acid cloud.On the morning of 4th February 2005 at 06.00 the public in the whole of Helsingborg Town was warned by a message broadcast on the radio. This message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information on this serious situation.During the rest of the morning the cordoned off exclusion zone was reduced so as to cover an area of about 1 square kilometre. This area houses approximately 7,000 inhabitants and the civil protection measures being taken greatly reduced their freedom of movement. The exclusion zone was further reduced later during the day, but still affected some 4,500 inhabitants. On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the Incident Commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. Consequences for the environmentAn area of about 100,000 sq.m. within the company's industrial area (dock area) was covered, for various durations, by the released sulphuric acid.Sulphuric acid is extremely acidic but moderately toxic for flora and fauna both on land and in water. Each year inspections of flora and fauna and substances toxic to the environment are carried out in the channel around Helsingborg, in accordance with the municipality's coastal inspection programme. At a meeting on 7th February 2005 between the company, the county administrative board and the municipality a pH level of 3.5 was recorded in the company's dock. The decision was then taken that more detailed environmental impact inspections are required and that the company shall present a programme for this to the county administrative board. This decision resulted in KKAB carrying out the following three studies in and outside Kopparverk Harbour.KKAB has in conjunction with a consulting firm carried out a number of pH measurements, in Kopparverk Harbour. During the first week, after the incident very low pH levels were measured in the harbour. After ten days the levels were however close to normal, with the lowest pH level being 6.5. Samples taken about two weeks after the incident from the central and outer parts of the harbour and in adjoining parts of the \u00d6resund channel showed close to normal pH levels. In none of the sample points was the pH level lower than 7.6.The municipal health and environment protection committee in Helsingborg town conducted studies of the marine environment in and outside Kopparverk Harbour on 1st March 2005. Their report states, Well arranged studies of watercourse fauna on 1st March 2005, just over three weeks after the sulphuric acid emission in Kopparverk Harbour in Helsingborg, do not suggest any large scale effects. All vegetation was killed in the harbour and in the harbour entrance area while clear effects couldn't be identified 300 metres away. Follow-up studies will be carried out at the end of April, when a larger area will be covered.Another consulting firm has on commission from KKAB studied the coastal marine environment in and outside Kopparverk Harbour. The results from this report indicate that there has been a strong effect furthest in in the harbour. In the outer parts of the harbour the study shows normal conditions for the area as regards to flora and fauna. The results from the studies show that the sulphuric acid emission into Kopparverk Harbour had a serious affect on local flora in the inner and deepest parts of the harbour and harbour entrance area. The emission has been assessed by the company as not having had any major negative effects on the \u00d6resund channel. Follow ups will be carried out within the framework of Helsingborg' coastal inspection programme.KKAB has in laboratory tests, since the incident, shown that when sulphuric acid is diluted by seawater some of the chlorine is converted to hydrogen chloride gas. Calculations have shown that approximately 11.5 tons of hydrogen chloride gas can have been produced at the time of the incident. As hydrogen chloride gas is enveloped in a cloud of steam the hydrochloric acid was probably absorbed by the water particles and thus hydrochloric acid with a concentration of approx 4% was produced. It has not yet been determined whether or not the airway irritation that some nearby residents experienced was due to the sulphuric acid aerosol or to hydrogen chloride gas. The reaction that occurred between the water and sulphuric acid in the dock is not believed to have led to any gas formation, because the reaction took place under the surface and any gas produced would have been absorbed in the water above it. Community Disruption:A message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information about this serious incident.During the rest of the morning the cordoned off exclusion zone was reduced so as to cover an area of about 1 square kilometre. This area houses approximately 7,000 inhabitants and the civil protection measures taken greatly reduced their freedom of movement. The exclusion zone was further reduced later during the day, but still affected some 4,500 inhabitants. On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the incident commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. Discussion:Perhaps. in retrospect, the cordoned off zone was too large and lasted for too long, which reduced the freedom of movement of many people. Precautions taken were to ensure that no one came to harm."

Plant managers scaled up the recipe to produce the required larger amount of polymer, and added all of the additional monomer needed into the initial charge to the reactor. This more than doubled the rate of energy release in the reactor, exceeding the cooling capacity of the reactor condenser and causing a runaway reaction. The reactor pressure increased rapidly. Solvent vapors vented from the reactor's manway, forming a flammable cloud inside the building. The vapors found an ignition source, and the resulting explosion killed 1 worker and injured 14. The blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board. False False False False",
        "causes_description": "causes:  On the day of the accident, a modification in the production recipe was introduced in order to produce approximately 12% more of the final product obtained from a normal batch. The plant superintendent determined the quantities of solvent, monomer and initiator needed for the reaction, which initially was not particularly vigorous. Several minutes later, the senior operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway, which forced him out of the building. He returned with a respirator and was able to start emergency cooling water flow to the jacket. However, the building exploded 30 seconds after he left.Investigations after the accident revealed that there were several causes that led to the runaway reaction.- The company did not perform hazard identification of their processes. No formal hazard review had been conducted to address what could go wrong during reactor operations. The company had minimal safety information on its polymerization processes, even though this was the core of its manufacturing business. Product formulations were optimized to meet customer specifications. However, reaction characterization and calorimetry were not performed to establish process equipment performance requirements. Indeed, calorimetry experiments performed after the accident proved that the modifications on the recipe generated a heat output that was 2.3 times that of the original recipe, clearly exceeding the heat removal capacity of the condenser and the emergency jacket cooling of the reactor.- When scaling-up new products from the laboratory, previous plant managers had typically estimated initial production batch sizes based on past experience, or with simple trial-and-error systems. Batch quantities were gradually increased until the sight glass in the condensate return line showed that the condenser was too close to flooding, or that another performance limit, like the reactor pressure increase, was being approached. The condenser's cooling capacity was not documented, nor could the cooling load be determined with the available instrumentation. As a result, information essential to the safe operation of the reactor was not available.- Most of the management and operations personnel had been on the job less than one year (in some cases much less) and lacked previous polymer manufacturing experience. Personnel, including site managers, were thus poorly prepared to recognize potentially hazardous changes to product recipes, or to respond to an incipient runaway reaction. Additionally, the company had no chemical or other engineer on staff, and none had been contracted to evaluate the hazards associated with reactive operations at the site.- Based on the accident investigation, it turned out that the employees and managers had little or no understanding of reactive hazards. They had not been trained on, and did not understand, the safety margin of safety needed or available in their polymerization operations. Furthermore, they had little knowledge of the sensitivity of the reactor to changes in product recipes, batch sizes or reaction conditions.- The company relied primarily on a procedural safeguard to prevent loss of reactor control: the batch sheet, which was used as an operating procedure at the site. But additional process safeguards, necessary when coping with the effects of runaway reactions, where totally missing in the reactor set-up. Examples of systems that could have helped to prevent or mitigate the accident are: - high pressure alarm systems. - automatic emergency cooling water to the reactor jacket. - automatic shut-off of initiator feed. - automatic injection of short stop solution to stop the polymerization reaction. - automatic venting or dumping of the reactor to a safe location.- After the investigation of the accident, it was found that operators used to open the reactor manway after every batch cycle to clean the reactor. Long standing practice at the facility was to then close the manway and secure it using only 4 of the 18 clamps specified by the manufacturer. The risk posed by this practice had not been recognized because the reactor normally ran at near-atmospheric pressure, for which four clamps were thought to be adequate. Under this situation, it was estimated that the manway began to leak flammable solvent vapors when the reactor pressure reached approximately 23 psig, well below the reactor's maximum allowable working pressure of 75 psig.- The design of the tubular heat exchanger used as a condenser made it difficult to remove for inspection or cleaning. Inspection of this equipment after the accident showed that it was badly fouled, likely reducing the condenser capacity at least 25 per cent. The company had no program to systematically monitor and control water side fouling, and it was found that there was not any inspection or cleaning process to remove the scale, rust and sediment accumulated on the tube during 30 years of service. management organization inadequate organized procedures staffing process analysis design of plant/equipment/system testing/inspecting/recording instrument/control/monitoring-device failure",

He notified a senior operator and both shut down the operation. They evacuated and warned other workers to do the same. After 10 minutes the cloud ignited and there was an explosion.Among the causes that led to the accident, the following can be cited:- The investigation after the accident revealed that the tank temperature controller had not been installed or maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications, which could have caused it to fail.- The mixing tank was not equipped with a temperature display or high temperature alarm, and there was no backup shutoff device. The procedure for this mixture required the operator to verify the temperature by climbing the stairs to the upper level to measure it using a hand-held infrared thermometer. If after checking the temperature, the mixture overheated, the operator would not know until the vapours overflowed from the tank.- The ventilation in the mixing area, consisting of local exhaust and area ventilation systems, was incapable of controlling vapours released from the tank, since it was not designed to capture and remove a high volume of vapours released from an open tank, and because two exhaust fan drive belts were broken before the incident. Regarding the area ventilation systems, they were located at a significant distance from the tank, so they were incapable of removing the vapours.- The mixing room was designed to avoid ignition sources, but the adjacent area where the cloud migrated and most likely ignited was not.Therefore, if the design for the process had included proper safety controls (i.e. local exhaust ventilation, high temperature alarm, and a backup steam shutoff) the vapours would not have overflowed the tank and migrated into the adjacent areas where multiple ignition sources existed. design of plant/equipment/system instrument/control/monitoring-device failure",

A ship equipped for hydrocarbon recovery was stationed at the mouth of the river while two trawlers recovered hydrocarbon pellets from the river.Investigations revealed that the leak was detected only after 5 hours , 478 tonnes of fuel were spilled, of which 180 tonnes flowed into the river Loire.Subsequent to the spill public access restrictions to several beaches and fishing prohibition in the river estuary were issued and were gradually lifted between the 04/04 and 18 /04.

The corrosion resulted from a water leak in a pipe located above the pipeline. Water infiltrated under the thermal insulation, causing corrosion and subsequently the fuel pipeline rupture.

Water flowing from a perforated pipe, positioned vertically above the fuel oil pipeline, infiltrated under the leaky thermal insulation layer, first causing the steel to corrode and then perforating the pipe.A pipe verification and maintenance programme was adopted for the refinery site in accordance with a procedure developed in April 2007and designed to establish the various inspection and maintenance periodicities depending on the type of pipe configuration and potential vulnerabilities.The importance of specific maintenance works on the pipe where the leak occurred was however poorly evaluated in this programme, despite a number of warning signs during the preceding months on this particular group of pipes and despite the potentially serious consequences of an accident affecting one of these pipes given the proximity to the riverbank. management organization inadequate maintenance/repair corrosion/fatigue",

Pollution cleanup efforts,in some cases requiring mobilisation of up to 750 people at the same time, lasted three and a half months to clean not only some 60 km of fouled riverbanks, but also wetlands further inland (swamps, reed beds, etc.).Public access restrictions were issued for certain beaches and fishing was prohibited in the estuary; the restrictions would gradually be lifted between 04/04 and 18/04/2008.The environmental impact assessment on the flora and fauna was promptly initiated by setting up an accurate inventory of the number of affected birds. Observations performed twice a week by the National Office for Hunting and Wildlife revealed that that the number of bird deaths caused by this pollution spill was less than 10 throughout the entire Loire- Atlantique Department. The proportion of oiled birds kept decreasing as pollution cleanup progressed, with the affected bird population gradually leaving the area as time went by.Nonetheless, several tens of dead animals were recorded in both the Vend\u00e9e and Charente- Maritime Departments over the following days, even though no scientific causality correlation could be established, especially given the type of species involved.The operator provided most of the manpower and took financial liability for all damages, pollution cleanup costs and compensations to affected professionals."

The explosion was not followed by any fire.

An operator with a mobile probe went to ignite the pilots when the superheater exploded. The corpse of the operator and of a second employee were found under the debris of the collapsed bottom of the superheater.The explosion was probably caused by the accidental accumulation of a flammable gas mixture and an ignition source which could not been determined.

Other ignition sources could also be envisaged (e.g. electric spark, static electricity), yet these two cited sources would seem the most plausible. A number of elements favoured the onset of this accident, whose serious consequences were tied to the presence of personnel in the vicinity of the superheater during manual ignition: - failure to steam-sweep the superheater prior to its re-ignition, as stipulated in the operating procedure issued by the plant management; - gas input via a burner, despite the flame on the associated pilot being extinguished;",

The electro-plating plant is located on the ground-floor of the hangar whereas a transformer-room (switch cabinet room) fed by a 20 kV line is located on the second floor. A fire spread from the low voltage switch cabinet over to 9 other low voltage switch cabinets. A series of high voltage cabinets located in the same room were partially damaged. Alarm was triggered by the fire alarm system. Fire extinguishing operations could be performed only after shutting down the high voltage feed. - Initially fire fighting operations started from outside of the room. Penetrating the room at that time was not possible due to the fact that the high voltage power supply to the room still had not been shut down. - Rescue service with two emergency doctors, 2 ambulances, 1 head of rescue operations- by 22:51 hrs the competent authorities were informed by telephone - An emergency response command office was set up with the participation of the fire brigade, representatives of the company, the office of the district president and the electric power provider - The fire could be extinguished in a relatively short time once the representative of the electric power supplier and the technical personnel of the company could establish that the electric power supply to the room had been shut off and that the room was grounded. - Apart from the damage directly caused in the room by the fire, approx. 50% of the company remained without electric power supply. The metal plating plant in the accident area was only affected by spreading combustion smoke. - By 23:14 hrs Secondary alarm of the voluntary fire brigade requesting a high-performance ventilator in order to free the hangar from the smoke. - By 23:30 hrs the onsite fire-brigade reported that the fire was extinguished. Following to that the decision was taken to activate the ventilator in order to free the hangar from the smoke. - By 00:15 hrs final meeting of the emergency response command deciding to continue forced ventilation for another 30 min. and then to switch over to natural ventilation. The firewatch was taken over by the onsite fire-brigade. A task force of 130 members participated at the emergency response operations onsite.

At the time of the incident Unit 35 had been taken temporarily off-line and its feed by-passed while planned repair work to the control system of the Unit\u2019s Emergency Shutdown System (ESD) was carried out. Whilst attempting to rectify a fault on the logic system, the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) failed totally on two occasions. The system was re-set after each failure. However, in between the two failures the flow control valve, FC201, situated between the failed pipe and the Dehexaniser column, and which controls the flow of the Naphtha feed into the column, was manually re-set to 15% open, the normal initial setting for starting up the column. This reduction in the valve opening created a greater resistance to sudden product flow and hence a higher pressure pulse in the feed line (although still within the design capability of the pipework) when the second start up occurred. It is likely that this increase in pressure found a weakness in the feed line as a result of the corrosion, causing it to rupture and release the naphtha product.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The incident was primarily caused by a structural failure of a 200mm NB Carbon Steel feed pipe to the Dehexaniser column on Unit 35. The pipe was insulated and the external surface of the pipe wall beneath the insulation had corroded at a region where water had been collecting. The corrosion had reduced the pipe wall metal thickness to a level that could not support the internal pressure of the process fluids and a major process release occurred. The escaping extremely flammable liquid found an ignition source resulting in a fire which caused extensive damage to Unit 35. Unit 35 was originally constructed in 1993 to relatively good standards of the time but nevertheless went into operation with a sub standard pipe installation. A walkway support bracket angle iron clashed with the pipe insulation weather cladding, which led to the water ingress at that location. The operating temperature of the pipe and wall wetting created conditions favourable to an accelerated corrosion mechanism. The corrosion progressed over time but remained unrecognised by the refinery ongoing integrity management systems until the failure occurred. In 2001, when the refinery was under different ownership, a company wide report had been produced in relation to Corrosion under Insulation (CUI). This recognised that CUI was endemic throughout the company\u2019s operations and a major threat. The refinery developed improved procedures for addressing the report recommendations but had not successfully implemented them up to the time of this incident. design of plant/equipment/system maintenance/repair testing/inspecting/recording corrosion/fatigue",
        "consequences_description": "consequences:  The outcome of the operator\u2019s failure to recognise Corrosion under Insulation (CUI) at the incident location, and failure to adequately inspect and maintain the plant with respect to CUI, was a large release of an extremely flammable liquid that ignited causinga fire that burned for approximately 3 hours. No physical injuries to any Petroplus employees or contractors were reported as a result of the incident. Accident reports were subsequently received from a contractor company operating at site regarding post incident shock experienced by five of their employees. The incident caused sufficient damage to close the refinery for approximately 8 weeks. Information given on the Petroplus website estimated that the costs of the repairs to the plant would be of the order of $15 million Firewater run-off was generally well managed and was contained on-site with little or no impact on the effluent treatment system."

The thunderstorm caused a complete power failure as well on the high voltage as on the low tension grid. There was consequently a stop of all the electrical motors. After the isolation of the installations, the restart was prepared during the night shift. The furnace had to be started first to have steam to be able to start the primary furnace the following day. Towards 00:55, an explosion occured in this furnace.At the change of shift, towards 21:00, the shiftleader was informed of the the blowdown that occured and that they were in restarting. He knew that the goal was to make 38 bar steam in order to be able to start in the morning. After various purging manipulations on the steam network, and some other works on the site, the victims went to the level of the tunnel burners of the furnace in order to check their closed position. According to the procedure, it is also necessary to make this check on all the other burners of the overheating section of the furnace. The shiftleader did not ask the victims to check the closed position of the valves of the other burners because during his last passage on site, he had noted that the valves of the tunnel burners were closed. He deduced from it that the closing of the burners was complete. He also checked the position of the regulation valves on the screen in the control room. They indicated 105 psi, which means that they were open. He was so convinced that they were closed and that he read a wrong value which incorrectly confirmed his belief they were closed. Wrongly, he opened the self-closing valve of the natural gas supply. Immediately a series of alarms activated, in particular alarms on the depression of the furnace which was not sufficient anymore. In the minute which followed, the explosion occured.

This estimated 10 m3 release corresponds to 130 kg of hydrazine hydrate, 70 kg of aminotriazole and 5.6 t of aminoguanidine formiate.The workshop was secured. To limit the consequences of this kind of release, the operator partially confined the pollution inside the plant's lagoons while lowering the rate of release into the natural environment (300 m3/hr instead of 800) and feeding clean water (900 m3/hr) into the Petite Baise to dilute the pollutant. Bleach (sodium hypochloride) was used to neutralize the hydrazine hydrate in the drainage pipes. The releases from the lagoons fell below the pollution threshold again after about ten days.The accident occurred during start-up after a routine operation to steam-clean lines and batch production equipment in order to remove the accumulated crystals of finished products.

The operating losses have been estimated at 0.5 to 2 million euros (9 days shut-down). The transition stage between decoking and starting-up the oven requires 2 valves to be operated: closing one of them to permit the release of decoking gases into the atmosphere after going through a cyclone, and opening the other valve to send cracking gases to the oil quenching column downstream. At the time of the accident, a mechanical problem prevented closure of the first valve, which was not detected by the computer or the personnel. Under these conditions, the valve between the oven and the quenching column was open, leading to the emission of 6 t of cracked gas from the oil quenching sector into the atmosphere.

The work carried out on one of the plant's boilers prevented removal by steam of the flaring exhaust gas; a cloud of smoke was visible from several kilometres away.The digester used nickel catalysis to convert hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) at a temperature close to 230  C. The H2 purified in this way from the CO can convert acetylene into ethylene, which is not the case when it is polluted with CO. The ethylene, which meets a relatively strict specification (5 ppm acetylene maximum) is then transformed into polyethylene.At 11.15 am on the day of the accident, a lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; insufficient supply of H2 to hydrogenate the acetylene resulted in a high output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site. The unit was back in service at 12 noon, but the time required to restore the system was underestimated, leading to the production of off-specification ethylene and consequently the need to flare it until 5 pm. 2.

Peracetic acid can cause an explosive reaction when getting into contact with sodium chlorite (CAS 7758-19-2).According to the NIOSH Material Data Safety Sheet sodium chlorite decomposes at 180-200 C producing toxic and corrosive fumes. It could be assumed that the sodium chlorite decomposed due to the initial violent exothermic reaction with the acid and then by the high temperature reached by the initial explosive reaction.

After the start-up tightness checks, valve SRV remained 3.5 % open. More specifically: During speed reduction, with valve VS4 closed (and tight), the pressure between the valves remained at 0 bars. On attaining the firing speed (420 rpm), the gas valves are opened (valve VS4, the main GCV1 gas valve is opened to 16 %) and the spark plugs are charged (for maximum 30 seconds). With the SRV remaining 3.5 % open, the pressure in the inter-valve section settled at 16 bars (it is normally 3.8 bars). An excessive gas flow was directed into the combustion chambers and the boiler (+7000 Nm\u00b3/h as against +2500 Nm\u00b3/h under normal circumstances with DCS).Firing occurred 19 seconds (normally +3 seconds) after main gas valve GCV1 started to open. This incident was caused by the SRV valve malfunction after the tightness test, but also by a failure to check the functioning of valves.

The emergency allowed the recovery of a quantity of product upstream of the sewage treatment equal to- 1250 tons retrieved at the treatment plant of the town - 300 tons recovered in the yards of Oil Depot for a total of about 1550 tons of product. Of the remaining 1050 tonnes of oil released into the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town have been recovered: - 100 tons by means curtains made in the rivers - 450 tons at the dam on the second river for a total of about 550 tons of recovered product. Therefore about 500 tons are scattered along the rivers between the treatment plant of the town and the sea with a total length of river courses involved more than 300 Km. The extensive data collected show that the immediate consequences of the spill occurred at the superficial part of rivers consist mainly in a black wave of hydrocarbons that has passed between 23 and 28 February 2010. Along the stretch of the nearby river downstream of the treatment plant of the town to the confluence with the second river a WWF protected area and some urban parks in other nearby towns were involved. Downstream from the mouth of the first river along the shaft of second river are present n. 27 ZPS-SIC bordering sites designated and protected under the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC and Birds Directive 79/409/EEC (recently revised by Directive 2009/147/EC). In a short time n.10 specimens belonging to two different species (cormorant and mallard) recovered in the hours following the event were died. From the findings identified by postmortem examinations apparent cause of death is poisoning not only by ingestion of hydrocarbons but also by transcutaneous absorption or inhalation. At the moment, an estimate of the animals killed by substances leaking is difficult, because many specimens of birds have been poisoned to death in remote and secluded areas. A comprehensive estimate of the damages is also difficult for the aquatic plant and animal communities that inhabit the ecosystems involved. Currently it is not possible to determine with certainty the actual amount of permanent or long-term damages to the various habitats caused by oil transit along the river courses and not intercepted by the actions of emergency put in place. Monitoring studies are being carried out under EC Directive 2000/60 involving different technical bodies both at central level and locally, with the goal of assessing the extent and impact caused by the discharge of hydrocarbons on the various environmental media (water, sediment, aquatic plant and animal communities). Only at the end of the monitoring activity it will be possible to obtain a complete picture of the actual extent of the damage, taking also into account the potential impact of the event on other water bodies and protected areas linked to the area directly affected by the oil spill. On-site The area affected by the event of release is located inside the industrial site and it is extended about 19,000 square meters. The first area of intervention has involved about 5000 square meters of land in front of the loading docks. First emergency activities have led to the production of solid waste due to the shelling of the land and the use of oil-absorbent material as well as aspiration of liquid waste from square, the API tank and the removal of the contaminated fluids derived from the decontamination of infrastructure in the depot. The solid waste has been stored in the establishment and partly disposed of by means of roll-off boxes and semi-ponds. The total quantity of soil/solid waste product is approximately 1700 tons for a fraction of oil products of 18 tons (identified on the basis of measured concentrations from the analysis of land). The liquid waste has been stored in tanks inside the plant provided by the Company. The amount of liquid waste was: 1060 tons of product hydrocarbon emulsions 569 tons of contaminated water 54 mc of sludge contaminated with hydrocarbons"

        "causes_description": "causes:  By driving forward the stacker with the IBC in a high position, the stacker became unbalanced. There were different main causes for this unbalance, which led together to the tipping over: - The IBC was lifted too high related to its weight, outside the specified working range of the stacker (this risk wasn't known to the operators). So the stacker was not adequate for this job.- The floor wasn't completely flat and horizontal : there was a small slope to a drain. The maximum height difference between the front wheels of the stacker caused by this slope was about 1 cm.- The operator just stepped off the platform of the stacker. By this action, the centre of gravity of the loaded stacker moved slightly forward.- The IBC wasn't filled to the top. 1 ton of HF-solution is less than 1000 litres. So the liquid was able to move inside the IBC, which effects the position of the centre of gravity of the IBC.At the moment of the accident, there was no risk assessment made by the company regarding to the procedure of filling the tank. Regarding to the handling of HF, there was a written instruction with some points of attention, but it didn't describe the filling activities.There is a training program for stacker operators in the company, which includes a specialised and certified training for fork-lift drivers. The operator involved in the accident only worked at the company for 10 months. At the time of the accident, he didn't pass through the whole training program, and he wasn't a certified fork-lift driver yet. Although, he was allowed to work with the stacker, because in the past he had a similar job. organized procedures training/instruction design of plant/equipment/system user-unfriendliness (apparatus, system, etc.) other operator error",
        "consequences_description": "consequences:  A contractor employee, installing a new apparatus in the vicinity of the mixing tank, was hit at the head by an edge of the falling IBC. By this impact he was thrown to the floor, where the fallen IBC was draining. The operator responded promptly by moving the victim away from the leaking liquid pool. During this intervention, the victim made a little contact at his legs with the HF-solution. He was treated immediatly with calcium gluconate gel.Another operator wanted to inform the people in the office about the accident. Without reflecting about the best way to do this, he took the shortest way and ran through the liquid pool. The soles of his shoes were damaged by the HF and his feet also needed a treatment with calcium gluconate."

Primary (atmospheric) fuel oil, the raw material of the vacuumrectification process of fuel oil, is supplied to furnaces KR-601/1,2 byS-601/1,2,R pumps via feedwater heaters by two flows. The partially evaporatedfuel oil that is heated in furnaces then enters into K-601 vacuum column by twotransfer pipelines. Four load layers are mounted in the K\u2011601 column. Achute-type humidifier is mounted over the third load layer and sprayerhumidifiers are installed over other load layers. Tare, which is the product resulting from the K-601 column,is extracted from the device by S-608/1,2 and S-613/1,r pumps for furtherprocessing.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  From 2 to 4 October 2006 repairs were carried out at omissis nafta of the KR\u2011601/2 furnace in section 001 of the KT-1/1 combinedtechnological device for deep processing of fuel oil; these works consisted ofreplacing the three worn out sections of the heating spiral in the radiationpart of the furnace. After completing the works at 8:00 in the morning of 12October 2006 the work was begun on starting up the KR-601/2 furnace. Theburners were ignited in the KR\u2011601/2 furnace, the temperature was raised andthe furnace heating spirals were filled with fuel oil, which began feeding intothe K-601 column at 9:28 of the same day. Prior to connecting KR\u2011601/2 to thesystem, the raw material was fed into the K-601 column by heating it in the KR-601/1reserve furnace. The technological parameters of the KR-601/1 furnace and K\u2011601column were within the allowed limits. The KR-601/2 furnace was connected to the system bygradually raising the temperature of the raw material supplied to the column.According to the technical regulation of the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tarvisbreaking section 001 of the combined technological device KT-1/1 for deepprocessing of fuel oil, the temperature of the supplied raw material needs tobe raised by 30 to 35 C per hour. It is apparent from the analysis of the diagramsof technological parameters that from 12:55 to 14:24 the temperature of the rawmaterial being supplied was rising by 38 to 45 C per hour, meaning that thelimits specified in the technical regulation were being exceeded. Certain other divergences from the technological regime canbe seen from the diagrams of the parameters of the technological regime: - at 9:32 and at 9:48 the vacuum pressure in the columndecreased to 104.435 mm Hg st. and 67.018 mm Hg st. respectively (usually the vacuumpressure in the column is about 20 mm Hg st.); - from 13:37 the level of tar started decreasing sharply atthe bottom of the K\u2011601 column, and at 14:24 the measuring devices could notregister it at all. According to the technical regulation, the level of tar atthe bottom of the column must remain within the limits of 40 to 90%; - from 14:00 to 14:23 the pressure of the cleavage gas inseparators SP-603/1 and SP-603/2 started increasing sharply (from 0.53 bar. to-0.335 bar.); - from 10:55 to 12:25 the total amount of raw material beingfed into the K-601 column was about 544 m3/h. At 13:55 the amount of the rawmaterial being supplied decreased to 447\u00a0m3/h. The debit was increased,and at 14:25 the amount of the raw material being fed into the column was 520m3/h. At 14:30 the supply of the raw material into the column stoppedcompletely . - At 14:24 there was a complete absence of vacuum pressurein the K-601 column; - At 14:30 the S-608 pump stopped pumping and was operatingan empty cycle. The Communication Point of the Operative Management Sectionof the Fire Rescue Service of omissis received the fire alarm fromthe K-601 column at 14:32 after the fire safety alarm was set in bases Nos 6and 7 of section 001.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The commission found during the investigation that, accordingto the drawing contained in the technical passport of the K-601 column, the 150mm long junction pipe at the bottom of the column ends with a coupling junction,however, the junction pipe is actually mounted by connecting it to the technologicalpipeline No\u00a0619/1 with a welded connection. These technical modificationsare not shown in the drawings of the technical passport of the K-601 column. Itwas found during the investigation that the design solution to replace the couplingjunction with a connection by welding was adopted and approved in 1987. On thebasis of the same solution, the steal containing 5% Cr and 0.5% Mo (steal typeaccording to GOST 5520-79), as foreseen in the initial project for theproduction from the 426 x 10 pipe of the elements of the technological pipelineNo\u00a0619/1 connected to the junction pipe of the K\u2011601 column, was replacedby carbonic construction steal 22K, according to GOST 5520-79. According to theglobally recognised methods against corrosion, if the technological productsulphur content exceeds 0.5% and the product temperature exceeds 260 0C, corrosionand heat-proof metal must be used (as was foreseen in the initial project). Asthe technological product sulphur content of the K-601 column and the producttemperature highly exceeds the values referred above (2.6% and 625 0Caccordingly), it can be stated that the replacement of the type of steal was aninadequate solution that resulted in the corrosion of the pipelineNo\u00a0619/1. This is confirmed by tests carried out during the investigation,according to which, the metal of the wall of the separated pipe in the pipelineNo\u00a0619/1, between the parts of the vacuum column and the separation valve,is affected by inter\u2011crystal corrosion and bottom layer erosion (corrosion).The investigated parts of the technological pipeline No\u00a0619/1 wereaffected by erosion (corrosion) at the time of operation and up to the momentof fire. It is likely that the thinning of different walls of the pipe waspredicated by erosion (corrosion) before the fire. The thickness of the wall insome places was only 0.15 mm. It was found during the investigation that, at the moment whenthe fire was detected and during the extinguishing of the initial fire, it was thebottom part of the K-601 column, located in the intermediary area of thepedestal of the K-601 column and between feedwater heaters of the column andsection 001 of the KT 1/1 technological device that was on fire. According to the opinion of the investigating commission,the most likely reason for the fire in the section 001 of the KT 1/1 combinedtechnological device for deep processing of fuel oil is the ignition of thetechnological product (tar), previously heated to the self\u2011incinerationtemperature, after this product burst out through the crack (or cracks) in thepart affected by corrosion of the technological pipeline No 619/1 between thejunction pipe of the K-601 column and the separating valve. Such cracks mayhave resulted from the thinning of the wall in the part of the said pipeline tothe level that it was not able to resist the pressure load. It results from the analysis of the technical regulation ofthe vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar visbreaking 001 section of thecombined technological device KT-1/1 for deep processing of fuel oil, that theactions of the technological staff faced with changes in technologicalparameters (tar level at the bottom of the K-601 column (the cube) or vacuumlevel inside the column K-601) and their technological management are notstrictly regulated and the technological staff operating the device acts on thebasis of instructions from their directors or based on their own personalexperience. At the time of the accident the staff operating the device noticesany change in technological parameters (decrease of the tar level at the bottomof the column and sudden decrease of vacuum in the column itself) attempted torestore the parameters, by regulating the column load and the tar debit fromthe bottom of the column, but at that time the product was already comingthrough the possible place of dehermetisation in the part of the technologicalpipeline No\u00a0619/1 between the K-601 column junction pipe and theseparating valve. It has almost been an hour (from 13:37 to 14:30) that no oneof the operating personnel passed through the K-601 column and inspected it orthe related equipment, in order to identify the reasons for the decreased tarlevel in the cube of the K-601 column. On 15 October 2004 the management plans approved by thechairperson of the board of omissis provided for the reduction ofoperating costs, by extending the intervals between general repairs by at least4 years and more, and, at the same time, for the improvement of the long-termreliability of devices. According to the commission, this decision fails toimprove the long-term reliability of devices, as the repairs of separatedevices, without stopping the production for general repairs, cannot allow thefull taking into account of the wear and tear of the devices and theircondition. The last general repairs at omissis were carried out in2003, and the repairs planned for 2006 were postponed. The manufacturer set a service period of 11 years for theK-601 vacuum column (technical passport of the device, page 129, Table 2\u201cTechnical characteristics\u201d). The inner condition of the K-601 column wasinspected on 26 September 1997 together with hydraulic tests. Based on theinspection and test results, also the investigations performed and conclusionspresented by the joint stock omissis, omissis decidedto extend the period of operation of the column (the fact recorded in thetechnical passport of the K-601 column). The last inspection of the inner and outer condition of theK-601 column was performed on 9 January 2006 (the fact recorded in thetechnical passport of the K-601 column). According to the requirements of theInstructions No\u00a0BM-2 for using pressure vessels, the next date for theinner and outer inspection of the column was set to 9 January 2010, i.e. theplanned frequency of the inspections was 4 years. Acting on the basis of the Instruction for the use ofpressure pipelines No\u00a0BM-4, approved Order No\u00a083 of the deputydirector for production technology and capital integration of omissisof 23 April 2004, the pipeline maintenance engineer of the Diagnostic Facilityperforms the technical inspections of the pressure pipeline No619/1 (from the K-601column to the pumps S-608, S-613/1, S-613/2). The last inspection of the operatingpipeline No\u00a0619/1 (hereinafter referred to as IOP) and the fullverification of its technical condition (hereinafter referred to as VTC) wasperformed on 15 December 2004. The inspection found some minor shortcomings,however, it concluded that the repairs of the pipeline were not necessary, andthe next inspection dates were set accordingly at 15 December 2008 for IOP and15 December 2010 for VTC (the fact recorded in the technical passport of theK-601 column). organized procedures supervision design of plant/equipment/system corrosion/fatigue operator error",

Polyethylene leaked from a high-pressure compressor during the regular production of low density polyethylene. This was caused by the presence of cracks on two cylinders valves of a second grade compressor. Approximately 80 to 100 kg of ethylene escaped through the cracks at a pressure of 2600 bar. The vapour then dispersed throughout the compressors room before igniting. At the same time, the safety program was automatically activated to stop the high pressure compressor and to vent the gases through pipes so to reduce the pressure. However the presence of fire ignited about 1200 kg of gas which was present in the pipes. The fire in the compressor room was extinguished within two minutes whereas the fire in the venting pipes was extinguished within 17-20 seconds.

Several tanker cars were involved in the derailment. Many of the derailed cars contained\u00a0chlorine, propane, butane, toluene and styrene. Following the derailment, several tanker cars were punctured resulting in the release of chlorine, butane and propane. The ruptured butane and propane cars experienced BLEVEs. The tanker containing approximately 90 tons (81.6 tonnes)\u00a0of liquid chlorine was also ruptured. Large quantities of chlorine escaped, either consumed in the BLEVE flames or converted to chlorine gas and released to air. An evacuation order for the initial accident area was issued early in the morning\u00a0of November 11, 1979. The evacuation zone was continuously expanded because of shifting winds. At its peak, 218000 of a total population of 284000 were evacuated. The evacuation order was lifted for most people after several days; however, 72000 evacuees were required to remain evacuated until November 16.While fighting the resultant flames of the derailment, the decision was made to let the flaming propane tanks burn out and wait for the tank cars to cool before attempting to stablize the scene and remove the remaining quantities of liquid chlorine.

The process control in manual operating mode contributed to the damages that resulted, as the reaction would not have occurred if the intended dwell time for the affected materials had been retained. The shutting down of the cooling system also seems to have exacerbated the damage, though it is questionable whether the reaction heat could have been conducted away without damaging the heat exchanger.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On 15 February 2010 a release of about 29 tonnes of EL fuel oil occurred in a tank farm during a transfer operation, causing environmental damage. The release took place at the coupling of a pipe bend flanged to a product pipe, to which a DN 80 hose was attached to connect to a mobile pump. The mobile pump was intended to drain an EL fuel oil tank by about 04:45 during the night shift. For this the mobile pump was set up near the tanks on an open space and connected to the tanks by means of flexible hosepipes with the appropriate piping.After the pump was switched on the process was checked by employees and no anomalies or leaks were found. The workers returned to the tank farm control room, from where the operation was monitored on the basis of the oil level (rise in the level in the tank to be filled). 25 minutes after the start of pumping the level indication on the monitor was seen to switch from rise to fall. Alarmed by this, the employees immediately returned to the pump and found that the hosepipe had become detached at the coupling of the pipe bend on the product pipe. EL fuel oil from the filled tank was being released in free flow out of the parted hosepipe and at the same time via the still running pump out of the tank to be emptied. The escape of fuel was stopped by manually closing slide valves on the tanks and pipeline and by switching off the pump.The hose concerned is a standard chemical hose. The coupling is a 'filling pipe' coupling or 'tank wagon' (TW) coupling according to DIN 28450 (EN 14420-6). Such couplings can be regarded as standard, especially in the petroleum industry. They are also called quick connect couplings. The male and female parts are put together and the connection is made in slightly under a single turn. The coupling is then secured or self locked. Safety function:Slide valves on tanks and piping closed manually and pump switched off.As much as possible of the fuel oil released in the sump of the pump was pumped back into the tank.Further action was taken in accordance with the site's general emergency response plan (AGAP) to limit the environmental damage. The environmental damage was caused by a combination of shortcomings and errors:1.\tDue to the infrastructure, some tank farms do not have a stationary system for dealing with residues, which is why it was necessary to use mobile equipment.2.\tA non return valve fitted on the pressure side when the mobile equipment was assembled would have prevented a reflux of product and considerably reduced the extent of the damage. Ultimately, however, product would still have been released due to the still running pump and the open connection.3.\tIt has not been possible to determine conclusively why the tank wagon (TW) quick connect couplings became disconnected.

In order to direct or close off the flow, the distributor is divided up and delimited by section valves. The main BFG distributor is equipped with pressure traps which act as a safeguard if the pressure exceeds 12kPa. There are 32 of them. Connected to the BFG distributor are, amongst other things, combustion stacks 2 and 3, which are used to burn residual BFG. At the top of the stacks are burners which are supplied with natural gas, with the aid of which the BFG is burnt.\u00a0Pressure traps which had burst open after critical pressure values in the region of 18kPa were exceeded were the source of the MIA. Out of the total number of pressure traps, 26 had burst open, five had been taken out of operation owing to an overhaul of the BFG storage tank, and one \u2013 A248 \u2013 had not burst open (as recorded by CO sensors). Combustion stacks 2 and 3, which released non-combusted BFG, were another source.The Company's plant is equipped with external and internal CO leakage monitoring systems.

The values for releases from individual traps are recorded in chronological order.",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  At 06:37 on 16 November 2006 the plant experienced a drop in its power supply, i.e. a reduction in voltage on lines 277 and 278, which supply the plant with electricity from the nearby substation. This brief drop in voltage triggered the closure of the BFG supply pipes, resulting in the shut-down of the main BFG draw-off points (heating-plant boilers Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the combustion boilers of push furnaces 1 and 4) and other, smaller BFG draw-off points at the plant. This caused a substantial increase in pressure in the main BFG distributor (about 16 kPa), followed by the extinction of the burners on BFG stacks 2 and 3 (increase in BFG flow to maximum) and the bursting open of pressure traps on the main BFG distributor (26 traps). This resulted in a release of BFG, which was signalled by the CO monitoring system (external and internal CO monitoring at the plant). The CO release was reported at 06:45 and emergency control arrangements were put in place; the Energy Division\u2019s control centre requested a reduction in the supply of BFG by 200 000 Nm3/hour, by reducing blasting. At the same time, action was taken by the company\u2019s own fire brigade (air quality monitoring, adding and closing of pressure traps, evacuation of employees), and by the company\u2019s private security service (closure of roads). After the necessary technical measures had been performed on the installations (gradual ignition of the burners of the heating plant boilers and of the combustion boilers of the push furnaces, shut-down of blast furnace No 2 \u2013 interruption of the blasting of hot air, resulting in a reduction in the production of iron and of BFG), pressure in the main BFG distributor gradually fell until a stable value of 2-6 kPa was reached. At 08:00, the levels of released CO in the air were falling, as most of the pressure traps had already been closed. At 09:05, the company's fire brigade stopped monitoring CO levels at the plant and in its immediate vicinity; the CO values were within the legal limits. The evacuation was completed; production continued unchanged after the MIA had been dealt with. Seven vehicles equipped with measuring devices for monitoring CO releases to air were deployed.The evacuation of the plant\u2019s employees and employees of external firms was organised and directed by controllers from the Coking Plant, Hot-Rolling, Cold-Rolling, Transport, Service and Energy Divisions, and implemented by the company\u2019s fire brigade, company's fire brigade, and its private security service. A total of 359 people were evacuated. The evacuation point was determined in accordance with the divisional emergency plans and in line with measurements taken using personal analysers; nobody was injured during the evacuation.No injuries were sustained by employees and no damage was done to technical installations during the MIA, the major occurrence of which took place between 06:37 and 08:45.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  At May 19, during the night, an Ethylene Oxide ( EO) railcar was discharged. This situation only occurs during shortage of EO , e.g. during turnaround phases. Normally railcars are not discharged, but loaded, however the most of the EO is used internally. Prior to the unloading, a cooling unit in the storage area was taken out of production for cleaning and was re-commissioned. This operation included isolating this unit by means of \u2018blinds\u2019. After applying startup procedures the operator started the discharge operation. Such operations for safety reasons are exclusively carried out during night shifts. Initially a small batch for quality assessment was discharged into a dedicated tank without any problem. Shortly before the incident, the transport line was rechecked by the operator, valve settings were adjusted to facilitate transfer to the main spherical storage tank. Upon commencing transfer, the operator encountered problems generating a sufficient flow from the pump. Several re- checks of ( valve, pressure etc.) settings and lineups, and confirmations were carried out. After restart attempts, and increasing (nitrogen) vapour pressure in the railcar, an apparently normal pressure gradient and fluid flow was monitored. Sometime later, EO gas alarm was triggered, that shortly thereafter ceased an next was interpreted as a \u2018false peak alarm\u2019. Shortly after shift switch, the EO transfer operation was halted as a normal safety precaution. The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night. This obviously alerted senior management, and soon it was concluded that the entire transferred volume ( 32,5 tons) had found its way into cooling water discharge point via a Pressure Relief Valve. Immediately, the local emergency team was established and started the impact assessment. Simultaneously, local authorities as well as the AKZO Nobel Corporate Emergency response team were alerted, and a independent investigation of the incident by corporate and independent experts with support of the Board of Management was initiated.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The following conclusions are drawn up on account of the investigation: Operating error plus incomplete application of Management of ChangeCombination of an operating error (leaving a blind flange in place) plus an incomplete application of a Management of Change procedure (maximum allowable operating pressure not in line with the pressure relief valve settings) led to over pressurization of the EO transport system. As a consequence EO material found its way through the relief valve into the cooling water system and finally to sea water. Cleaning the EO Cooler was executed not following a work permit nor was it planned and controlled in the strict turnaround regime.Isolating the cooler in the EO transport system by own personnel for cleaning, remained outside the turnaround (plant maintenance stop) work scope and did not trigger inclusion of these activities into the strict turnaround control routine, nor was it included in a work permit routine. Work permits are issued only for contractors working on the installations. This was one of the causes that contributed to the error in the blind flange procedure. Informal shift handover at operator level and deviation from standard operating procedures.Coordination and handover of activities to be carried out by different operators is informal and the assessment and response to operational deviations is largely delegated to operators, with no stringent requirements to involve line management. This was one of the main causes that contributed to applying higher than normal pressures on the system and not discovering the fact that an additional blind that was put in the system. management organization inadequate training/instruction maintenance/repair component/machinery failure/malfunction instrument/control/monitoring-device failure blockage operator error",

Ethylene Oxide is toxic to microorganisms and fish. The LC50 value for fish is 84 mg/l (exposure time 96 hrs.) However, in free flowing water the EO concentration decreases continually due to a combination of evaporation, hydrolysis and biodegradation, as is underpinned by a diagram showing the EO concentration pattern in the affected Asker\u00f6fjorden."

Two shut-off valves (one metering valve and one pneumatic shut-off valve) must be closed before the water is added. The plant operator then opens the pneumatic shut-off valve using a process control system (PCS) and the water is added via the metering valve. The operator forgot to check if the metering valve was closed, so after the pneumatic valve was opened the full 30 l of water was released into the reactor, triggering a reaction, releasing hydrogen chloride and causing the reaction product to foam up. The gas-liquid mixture from the reactor escaping quickly through the exhaust pipes to the absorber increased the pressure in the reactor to at least 0.5 bar. This pressure surge resulted in the cooling coils breaking off two of the three vapour coolers. The hydrogen chloride/product mixture continuing to rise up from the reactor was thus able to penetrate through the cooling coils into the coolant pipe system and then escape through the pressure compensation tank opening into the building.

As soon as the gas warning sensors were triggered, the plant team immediately began to wind down the reactor using an elevated flare and to activate the reactor chamber's vapour barrier. Within 2-4 minutes, the alerted fire-brigade was on site and began cooling the lower third of the reactor area. As the leaking fluid (cyclopentene/cyclopentane) evaporates easily, instead of directly extinguishing the flames, the material was allowed to burn out in a controlled fashion. Around 15:30 the flames burned out in the reactor chamber and the residues from the process were burned with the elevated flare. The incident was confined to the reactor chamber. There was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages were concentrated on the reactor area, the compartmentation of which prevented the fire from spreading to other parts of the plant. At the time of the incident, there were around 40 t of a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons in the reactor.Around 10% of the mixture (rough estimate) leaked out through a break point caused by the explosion and was burnt.

Adiabatic compression of gas is seen as the possible cause of the ignition. The day before the incident (15 November 2010), a block valve on the reactor side was replaced. During its installation air probably got into the pipe section between the block valve on the reactor side and a second block valve, and the pipeline between the block valve on the reactor side and a control valve was probably then filled with cyclopentene (CPen) residue in gas or liquid form. This means that before the start of the nitrous oxide dosing, the relevant pipe section probably had a mixture of CPen residues and air of an unknown composition. The accident investigation concluded that the ignition of an explosive mix of nitrous oxide, cyclopentene/cyclopentane and probably very small quantities of air led to an explosion in the area of the block and bleed system of the nitrous oxide dosing of the CPon plant sector. There were also comprehensive investigations to determine the source of ignition as the potential trigger for the explosion. In two points, adiabate compression following the opening of the nitrous oxide valves could have created local hotspots. Adiabatic compression is considered as the possible cause of the ignition. No individual person actively made a mistake. The relatively new process, which is still being patented, and the low level of knowledge about the substances or mixture properties, particularly the mass explosiveness of nitrous oxide / cyclopentene mixtures is considered as the cause. design of plant/equipment/system",

In order to prevent their cooling from leading to crystallisation, circulation was maintained in an external heat exchanger containing a double-walled pipe dating from 1984. The effluents flowing into the interior pipe were heated by the steam injected between the two walls. At about 21:00 on 21 August, corrosion of a pipe inside the exchanger led to the appearance of several holes with a diameter of 1 mm and to the steam coming into contact with the effluents. The mixture was discharged into the condensate collector tank, the outlet valve of which was rapidly closed by the automatic control system, which had detected an excessively high level of conductivity. The contaminated condensates filled the tank to the point of overflowing before flowing into the retention basin. At 17:00 on 23 August, the operator detected the overflow and reopened the valve after misreading the display, believing that he had seen a value of 6 \u03bcS/cm (below the maximum threshold of 30 \u03bcS/cm), whereas the screen had changed scales, and was displaying 6mS/cm. The effluents flowed into two drainage ditches and then joined the Tauran. In the following 24 hours, the personnel switched off the site's alarms and the ratemeter that had detected radiological activity in the discharge channel leading into the Tauran, without proceeding to dispel doubts regarding the possibility of an accident having taken place. Only the daily analysis of the waters of the canal made it possible to pinpoint the discharge.",

This work was being carried out by a subcontract firm as part of a temporary modification to the wastewater treatment unit. There was a confined explosion of gas inside the tank which led to the roof of the tank being projected approximately 20 metres; the explosion killed one subcontractor and injured four other workers (three subcontractors and one company employee), all of whom were working on the modification. The SFB supply line had been emptied of wastewater coming from the distillery unit. The air vent of the tank, located on the roof of the tank, had been open as usual. The tank was approximately 50% full. Five workers were carrying out the work, four from the external firm and one from the company itself. The external workers had disconnected the SFB line by removing the shut-off valve on the entry duct on the roof of Tank TKX without closing it with the port's blind flange. One worker was standing on the roof of the tank near the open flange; the others were on the walkway giving access to the roof of the tank. They were beginning to cut the existing tube using a disc saw; sparks most likely produced by contact between the disc and the tubing ignited the explosive atmosphere which, unknown to them, had collected inside the tank. There was a confined vapour explosion (CVE) inside the tank which projected the tank roof approximately 20 metres.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The direct cause of the accident was the presence of a mixture of highly inflammable gases inside the TKX tank, ignited by sparks caused by a cutting disc during temporary modification work.The gas came from the sediment at the bottom of the tank. The conditions inside the tank, i.e. the lack of oxygen, encouraged the formation of populations of anaerobic bacteria which initiated fermentation, thereby producing various highly inflammable gaseous compounds, such as hydrogen and methane, which are lighter than air. In addition, the presence of sulphates means that a series of other (sulphide) gases may be produced which are extremely inflammable and much heavier than air. A vent was present on the tank roof; this allowed only the circulation of the lighter-than-air gases.The anaerobic conditions which led to the formation of the gases were due to a modification to the tank undertaken around ten years previously; this closed the air vents on the tank base which were included in the original plans. During operations the sediment would accumulate on the base of the tank in large quantities and under anaerobic conditions. The area had been considered to be non-dangerous within the meaning of the ATEX Directive.The work had been decided on in order to carry out a temporary modification without, however, adequately assessing the risks. The internal hot work safety procedure (isolation, clean-up, use of an explosimeter) was not applied. The fact that the work was carried out when the tank was full meant that the ignition of inflammable gases was inevitable.Various estimates have been made regarding the exact chemical breakdown of the gas inside the tank, but analyses and laboratory simulations seem to confirm that sulphide gases in layers lower down the tank were the main components, along with hydrogen and methane from layers higher up the tank. training/instruction supervision design of plant/equipment/system isolation of equipment/system maintenance/repair testing/inspecting/recording loss of process control wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties",

The explosion took place as soon as the disc saw touched the pipe. The roof was torn off along the welding line and thrown into the air; after flying over the adjacent tank TKZ it fell to earth around 20 metres away. The worker was thrown from the roof of the tank onto that of tank TKZ, where his body was found. He had probably landed on his back, thereby hitting the back of his head against one of the roof's reinforcing beams (double-t iron beams arranged in a radial pattern on the roof).The four injured workers, who suffered first- and second-degree burns on various parts of the body, were thrown off the TKX walkway onto the nearby TKY tank and fell down the exit ladder; all were given first aid by the company medical service and then taken to Brindisi hospital where they were treated, with expected recovery times ranging from 40 to 200 days.The material damage has been estimated at EUR 1.8 million for equipment and production losses, and EUR 0.8 million to restore the area to use, a total of EUR 2.6 million."

The incident was caused by the ignition of an 81 mm HE M512A1 mortar round during the final packing operation.One side of the pallet assembly was filley with 54 projectiles of 81mm. The problem occured while closing the transport containers of the mortar rounds. The mortar rounds are transported in plastic containers that hold 3 mortar rounds in seperate tubes. The operator experienced difficulties in loading the round into the containers and closing the container caps.The mortar round sometimes protruded more than normal from the plastic container and this made it more difficult to fit the retaining cap, to rotate it and to align it correctly. A gap remained between the container and the cap.The operator found that striking the retaining cap of the container with a mallet was enough to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position. According to the operator, the incident occurred when he struck the remaining cap with a mallet due to it being difficult to align and rotate.This was not the first time that the operator used the mallet to close the cap. One of the two operators at the packing operation had done the loading operation before but could not be considerd highly experienced since he was drafted in to performe this operation from another area of the site (machining).

Based on all test results, it's not possible that the mallet impact on the container cap caused the primary charge to ignite. The identified root cause is the ignition of the primer of the propulsion system of a mortar round by direct impact with the mallet onto the anvil. As all the containers of the pallet were filled with mortar rounds, it was demonstrated that it is highly probable that the operator directly but unintentionally hit the adjacent round during the closing container cap operation and made the primer function.Secondary causes are related with behavior, formation and management reaction on the operator's reports of problems (operators have already said to the management that problems existed with the containers but nothing was changed and they continued to use a mallet). management attitude problem training/instruction vessel/container/containment-equipment failure operator error",

Emergency services took eight employees who felt unwell (nausea, headache, vomiting) to hospital from a neighbouring company. They were discharged soon afterwards. The operator did not trigger its emergency response plan.The oxidiser of the unit producing calcium phenates stopped automatically when it was detected that the flame, which had previously been unstable, had been extinguished. It had already stopped during the night at around 01.00 but without significant impact. The stopping of the oxidiser caused that of the phenates unit, the H2S and mercaptan-type sulphur-containing effluents of which are also treated by the oxidiser (after passing through a tank in which those with the highest H2S content are converted). If they are not oxidised, these sulphur-containing effluents are released to the stack untreated. A similar incident three weeks previously affected five people at the same neighbouring company. The site was temporarily shut down as an administrative measure until the oxidiser was working reliably. The site risk assessment had not anticipated the accidental release of mercaptans. Production losses stood at several thousand euros. An expert's report showed the oxidiser flame to be outside the flame detector field as a result of combustion instability. This instability was caused by excessive dilution of the fuel (natural gas) with surplus oxidant (surplus oxygen and nitrogen contained in the effluent to be treated arriving at a rate of 8 000 kg/h). The expert's report made a number of technical recommendations to improve combustion (reduce and preheat the surplus oxidant, split the injection of fuel, etc.) and suggested that an activated charcoal filter be installed to trap mercaptans and H2S upstream of the chimney should the oxidiser stop working.

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On 23 October 2011, at about 21.00, a fire occurred at a plant used for the polymerisation of alpha-Methylstyrene (AMS) with acrylonitrile (ACN) with the help of the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), following a deflagration when pouring the radical initiator AIBN into a preparation tank with AMS.Emergency services were activated, the fire was extinguished by the on-site fire service, and all of the facility\u2019s systems were shut down by 22.40. One worker suffered serious burns during the incident. The fire caused extensive damage to the facility, in particular to the electrical cables and data communication. According to statements made by the plant manager, material damage amounted to about \u20ac3 million to \u20ac4 million. The investigation found that the incident was caused by unforeseen excess pressure in a preparation tank for a radical initiator.During a filling procedure, AIBN was released in the form of a dust cloud, which then ignited, injuring the employee working in the area. A second deflagration occurred when three open AIBN drums, which were near the reactor, ignited. This second deflagration was stronger than the first, and caused the extensive damage to cables and an electrical room. When the process control system activated the alarm, the system was shut down to put it in a safe condition. All input of material ceased, and the remaining reaction heat in the reactor was removed as quickly as possible using water in the cooling circuit.Within about 30 minutes the remaining initiator was used up, polymerisation stopped and the reactor cooled to room temperature. Sequence of events:19 October 2011Following a stoppage, the reactor was put back into operation and approximately 400 litres of AMS/ACN solution was poured in to seal the output pumps. Various problems with the ACN intake valves, as well other system valves, led to operation being suspended so that the intake system could be examined.It was subsequently established that the problems were caused by a faulty software update to the DCS system. As a result, the software update was repeated without further problems. The software error itself is not considered to be the cause or a contributing aspect of the incident. 23 October 201113.30: For the current production in the reactor, a new starting solution was created; the system was working normally, with no signs of any anomalies. 20.13: The shift workers determined that the reactor (due to the above problem of the inoperative intake system) was showing a pressure of 3 bars. A manual valve was opened to release pressure from the tank into the emergency release tank.The shift workers were not aware, nor could they have noticed, that releasing pressure from the reactor led to a pressure build-up in the emergency release tank.A subsequent calculation of the pressure patterns showed that the decrease in pressure in the reactor from 3 bars at 20.14 to 2.1 bars at 21.03 led to an increase in pressure in the emergency release tank from 1 bar to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.25: The growing pressure in the emergency release tank reached 1.2 bars, causing the white oil contained in the immersion tank to be pushed into the preparation tank.This assumption was confirmed by analyses of the contents of the preparation tank after the incident, which revealed the presence of white oil. Furthermore, in the gas phase of the preparation tank, organic compounds (acrylonitrile) were detected. This shows that the gas phases of the emergency release tank and of the preparation tank were connected and at the same pressure level at this time. The pressure in this combined system continued to grow to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.30: A worker left the measuring station to prepare the next batch of AIBN starting solution to be added to the preparation tank. He removed four drums of AIBN from storage and placed them on a trolley, removed all four lids and placed the first drum in the drum tipper. This was normal procedure. Approx. 20.50: The first drum was swung over the preparation tank and the slide valve on the tank was opened. As the second slide valve opened, a dust cloud issued from the funnel of the drum tipper, ignited and injured the worker, who at that point was standing at the drum tipper\u2019s control panel. A reconstruction of this situation shows that, when the second slide valve on the drum was opened, the excess pressure of 1.7 bars in the preparation tank lifted the drum out of the funnel by at least a few centimetres. The excess pressure blew the powdered AIBN out of the drum and into the surrounding area, leading to a dust cloud, which subsequently ignited. This ignition could have happened one of two ways:a) A brush discharge onto metal parts can lead to ignition of the mixture of AIBN powder and the gas phase containing organic components, orb) Ignition caused by brush discharge onto the inner lining of the drum.Both possibilities could arise from the drum being lifted up by the excess pressure and the resulting gap between the drum and the funnel, if a highly charged dust cloud with a high gas velocity issues from the gap. 21.03: The shift workers at the measuring station heard an explosion and saw multiple gas detector alerts on their screens. In front of the measuring station, they found the injured worker, who was wet from the emergency shower when he came into the measuring station. They noticed a large fire in the area of the drum tipper and immediately alerted the fire service and the emergency doctor.Because of the fire and the damage done to the cables, most of the DCS information was cut off.The investigation after the incident showed that the injured worker had most likely opened all four drums and left the lids on a shelf on the wall.The drum, which had been swung over the preparation tank, exhibited a large hole and was empty, and the metal rings of the other drums were found near the trolley that had been used to transport the drums from storage to the drum tipper. It is clear that, a couple of minutes after the first fire occurred, the fire caused by the dust cloud had ignited the other three drums (this was the explosion heard by the shift workers) and the cables on the wall behind the drums. 21.11: The on-site fire service fought the fire; all other persons evacuated the building.The cables on the wall bracket led to the central electrical room, behind the wall and one floor up. Some of the cables passed through the wall through sand traps, which were fire resistant, while others led to the electrical room through Hauff cable ducts with insufficient fire resistance. 21.36: Fire under control, worker on way to specialist clinic. 22.40: Fire extinguished, although the on-site fire service posted a fire watch until the next morning.

        "causes_description": "causes:  System error / management error 1. Creation of the AIBN dust cloud with subsequent ignition:When relieving the pressure in the reactor by opening the manual valve, the shift workers were not aware that that could overload the gas system of the emergency release tank. The occurrence of excess pressure in the preparation tank caused by opening a manual valve had not been taken into account in safety discussions, only excess pressure caused by the activation of safety valves had been considered; however, this should have become apparent due to the abnormal conditions in the polymerisation reactors.This approach was also supported by technology experts. This problem was made worse by a process modification in 2008, when the exhaust gas line of the preparation tank was attached to the emergency release tank, i.e. before the perforated disk in the exhaust system leading to the vent pipe. In addition, the pressure indicators on the preparation tank were installed such that the shift worker could not see them when operating the drum tipper.A HAZOP study was carried out on the polymerisation process; however, the preparation tank for the initiator was not taken into consideration, as it was not seen to entail a risk (due in part to the conclusion that excess pressure would be noticeable due to a disturbance in the polymerisation tank).The recommendation was made to carry out a HAZOP study on the AIBN system when it is put back into operation. 2. Second deflagration and the larger fire with resulting damage to cables and electrical room:Because all four AIBN drums were positioned and opened near the drum tipper, the first fire caused by the dust igniting was able to ignite a larger amount of flammable material, and the fire therefore became significantly bigger. Furthermore, the cable fire reached the electrical room through the Hauff cable ducts. The damage to the cables and in the electrical room meant that the facility was completely out of operation for longer.The decision to include the Hauff system in the factory standard, with reference to the on-site fire service, should be re-examined in light of this incident. 3. The seriousness of the shift worker\u2019s burns:The worker was wearing normal work clothing which was seen as appropriate to the activities.In light of this incident and the seriousness of the injuries he suffered because of it, the protective equipment for this activity and for the site must undergo a full review. management organization inadequate process analysis",

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  On 6 November 2012 at approximately 04:50, an explosion occurred in one of the company's batch reactors. A fire then spread towards the top of the building. According to the results of the investigation, molsidomine decomposition was the cause of the accident (molsidomine is an end product of the process and is not classified under Seveso legislation). Prior to commencing production in 2007, the company carried out tests to determine the decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine (151  C). Given that the temperature of the process does not normally exceed 55 to 60  C, the company believed the process operated under safe conditions. The accident ultimately occurred during the 9th production run. In reality, at the stage in the process at which the explosion occurred, 300 kg of molsidomine and 275 kg of pyridinium salts (product of the reaction between the solvent pyridine (R11) and HCl) remained in the reactor.The pyridine was fully distilled at the time of the explosion and only traces were left in the reactor. Tests carried out after the accident demonstrate that the decomposition temperature of this mixture (molsidomine + salts) is 91  C. The TD24 safe handling temperature is 65  C (there is no risk of explosion if heated for 24 hours) and the hazardous temperature begins at 75  C (there is a risk of explosion if exposed to heat for 1 to 8 hours), while the reaction process takes 7 hours. The double-jacketed reactor was steam-heated and as a result it is likely that the temperature in some parts of it exceeded 75  C (in the gas phase). The decomposition of the mixture could therefore begin and then sustain its own heatingin blobs onto the reactor wall in the gas phase. Overpressure destroyed the glass componentsof the reactor (and the rupture disk) and the blast wave spread throughout the reactor room. The fragile wall of the building was blasted away/destroyed which prevented damage being caused to the structure of the building. A few burning projectiles were propelled around the room but were very quickly put out by the emergency team and fire brigade. However, one burning projectile smashed through a glass panel in the corridor of the upper floor. This corridor was being used to store empty drums/IBCs and wooden palettes (there were no Seveso substances in this area). The fire therefore spread and caused great damage to the corridor. Given its high location (5th floor) and the fact that the exact contents of the corridor were not known (the explosions were, in fact, caused by the expansion of empty metal drums resulting from exposure to heat from the fire), it took some time to extinguish the fire. The fire in the corridor was finally out at approximately 09:00. As a result, this accident cannot be defined as a major accident as it did not involve any classified product.

Course of events at nitrile-amine plant:A connecting pipe between the filtration unit and fume scrubber, which is intended to relieve the pressure in an empty filtration unit, caused a liquid reaction mixture to enter the fume scrubber. The majority of the reaction mixture which entered the scrubber flowed into the waste water sewer via the overflow in the scrubber and could be contained by the grease trap of the nitrile-amine plant (approximately 4 700 kg). Approximately 1 000 kg* of the reaction mixture went through a vent stack to the roof of the nitrile-amine plant where it caught fire (most likely spontaneous ignition due to copper (Cu) catalyst it contained). During the subsequent firefighting operation, much of the water used to extinguish the fire entered the cooling water and rainwater sewers via the roof drainage. This water was channelled along the sewer into a retention basin of the central water reservoir. Approximately 8 kg of the reaction mixture was discharged into the Alz before the valve to the retention basin was completely closed. After the firefighting operation was complete, approximately 100 kg of additional reaction mixture which had contaminated the sewers was discharged over the course of 9 hours through the cooling water outlet into the Alz. Fish kill was caused along a 14 km stretch of the Alz. Three members of the fire brigade were hurt during the firefighting operation or suffered burns during the subsequent clean-up operation and received outpatient treatment.The member of staff from the nitrile-amine plant who discovered the fire was taken to hospital for precautionary reasons and placed under observation overnight. *The 1 000 kg (approx.) of product/copper catalyst mixture was discharged as follows:- Approximately 200 kg was contained in the retention basin,- Approximately 108 kg was discharged into water which entered the Alz,- The remainder (approximately 692 kg) either combusted or was also discharged into the Alz.

        "causes_description": "causes:  System error / constructionAt 18:53 on 6 March 2012 a \u2018cloudy run\u2019 was started in sector X, i.e. raw amine is pumped around in a circuit from the infeed through the filter until the product is clear and the next production stage (\u2018clear run\u2019) can begin. At 19:19 a ball valve between the filter and the central scrubber opens. This ball valve is only needed for the \u2018cake discharge\u2019 function and may not be opened in normal operation. The \u2018cake discharge\u2019 function is only performed two to three times a year to clean the filter. The production stages in the nitrile-amine plant are controlled automatically in the control room via a process control system (PCS) in \u2018step sequences\u2019. Since the ball valve is designed as a closing valve, its basic or safety position is \u2018OPEN\u2019 (zero position). At the end of the step sequence \u2018cake discharge\u2019 the ball valve is closed again. This position \u2018CLOSED\u2019 is maintained by the PCS until the valve is activated again.In September 2011 the PCS was converted to a new program which became operational in October 2011. Between the start-up of the new PCS and the incident on 6 March 2012 the \u2018cake discharge\u2019 step sequence was not activated. As a result of the conversion of the PCS the background information for the ball valve (\u2018CLOSED\u2019) was lost. The result was that, in automatic mode, the ball valve switched to its basic position \u2018OPEN\u2019. When the step sequence \u2018cloudy run\u2019 is started the PCS checks, among other things, whether the ball valve is closed. Therefore, in order to close the ball valve, when the new PCS started up the operating mode was switched from \u2018Automatic\u2019 to \u2018Manual\u2019. At the above-mentioned time the operating mode overview which the operator can call up indicated that the ball valve status was \u2018NOMINAL = A (AUTOMATIC), ACTUAL = M (MANUAL)\u2019. Instead of a green button as in automatic mode, the operating mode overview showed a red button with the message \u2018OK\u2019.Although the step sequence \u2018cloudy run\u2019 had been running without problem since 18:53, the operator switched the ball valve to Automatic and thus opened it. There was no safety check or locking of the ball valve in normal production operation.After the ball valve opened the control room received various messages about rising pH levels and increasing pressure and temperature.When the ball valve opened the pressure in the filter fell spontaneously to approx. 1.5 bar. At this pressure level the pressure at the filter in the waste gas scrubber also fell. The substance mixture entered the scrubber infeed (volume 2.5 m\u00b3) and filled it.The scrubber infeed is open to the atmosphere, i.e. not under pressure. As a result of the pressure in the filter the scrubber infeed and the attached vent stack were completely filled in the period 19:19 to 19:38. At 19:38 product overflowed from the stack (23.5 m high) onto the roof of the building and then at 19:43 the product mixture ignited. It must be assumed that the substance mixture discharged through the stack (approx. 1 000 kg, part of which burned off) also ran off the tin roof of the plant to the building annexed (gutter, downpipe) and onto the lower-lying flat roof, as the mixture of firefighting water and substances subsequently did during the plant fire service deployment. From there it ran through the rainwater drain pipe into the cooling water and rainwater sewer (InfraServ Gendorf sector).The scrubber infeed has a free overflow into the grease trap. Some of the approx. 4.7 t of the substance mixture ran out of the scrubber infeed through the plant waste water system to the grease trap and was contained there. The grease trap was sealed off at 20:02, so that from that time onwards no more plant waste water entered the central waste water cleaning installation. According to the operating instructions dated 4 November 2011, if product enters the manufacturing waste water sewer the grease trap must be closed immediately. Therefore the substance mixture had already been discharged through this drain before the fluid level in the scrubber had risen so far that the substance mixture could escape through the stack. Even during discharge through the stack, substance mixture continued to flow in the direction of the grease trap along the path described.The substance mixture and the contaminated firefighting water entered the Alz via the cooling water and rainwater sewer. This led to major fish kill and damage to other life in the lower Alz along a stretch of almost 15 kilometres.",

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  At approximately 07:00 in the foam production area, a TDI pipeline (in the cooling system) connected to a heat exchanger (plate-fin heat exchanger) was opened.After the circuit had been running for approximately 15 minutes, a pressure relief valve was activated and fluid (cooling water) was released.The TDI circuit pump was shut down and the TDI pipeline to the heat exchanger was closed off. Initial troubleshooting by staff. From approx. 08:30 supported by specialist firm which carried out the installation. The cause was identified as using the wrong pipelines. When the heat exchanger was fitted the product inlet (TDI) and the cooling water outlet from the heat exchanger were mixed up.This resulted in a short-circuit between the coolant (ethylene glycol/water) and the product (TDI). At that point it was not apparent that coolant had entered the TDI tank. It was not possible to foresee the subsequent effects of this. At approx. 11:30 the operating crew noticed that steam was coming out of the tank storage facility. They then inspected the tank storage facility and found that the steam was coming out of one TDI tank and that the tank had a raised temperature.The production management then immediately informed the company management. In addition, the production manager at a subsidiary site and the European Isocyanate Producers Association (ISOPA) emergency call centre were contacted for advice.The steam generation in the tank section of the storage hall had now become stronger and the temperature and pressure in the tank continued to rise. It could also be seen that material (liquid and foam) and steam were being released from the tank as gas escaped.Since it could no longer be ruled out that gas could also be released outside the tank storage building, at approx. 12:43 the operating crew called the public fire service.At approx. 13:00 the first members of the public fire service, police and rescue service arrived at the site. The public fire service was assisted by two works fire brigade units on site.At approx. 13:15 the competent authorities and the appointed external accident coordinator were also informed by the company management.Side by side with the emergency services deployed at the accident site, an emergency and crisis management team was set up in the administration building on 13 August 2013 for internal risk protection and emergency management. The team was made up of company operations managers, the accident coordinator, external emergency services and representatives of the authorities. Since the TDI contents of the damaged tank continued to display an exothermic reaction and thermal instability, to reduce the heat of the reaction the tank and the entire TDI tank storage building were permanently kept under a water curtain by the emergency services. Following the installation of various additional temperature-measuring devices, the reaction in the damaged tank could be measured and monitored, inside the tank and on its outer wall continuously by the emergency services in a safe room.The TDI tank affected had a double wall, which meant that the water curtain had only a small heat-dissipating effect. As described, the tank had to be cooled for several days by spraying (water curtain). Following the provisional all-clear on 16 August 2012, on 17 August 2012 the temperature rose again significantly, possibly as a result of the reduced spraying. The situation did not stabilise until 18/19 August 2012 as a result of the sustained cooling. To be safe, the public emergency response services continued cooling by spraying (water curtain) until it was clear from the temperature readings that the reaction had stopped. The investigation and clean-up work could then begin. The damaged TDI tank was inspected by specially trained fire service staff and other experts at the end of August 2013. The purpose of the inspection was to obtain a better assessment of the residual risk for salvaging the damaged tank and as a result determine the subsequent recovery procedure.Following a thorough examination, by agreement with the company operations managers, the local emergency services and representatives of the authorities, the tank and its remaining contents were disposed of safely with the aid of a specialised firm in September 2013 using a special industrial cleaning method (suction method). At the same time the expert appointed by the investigating authority began investigating the cause in accordance with \u00a7 29a BImSchG (Federal Immission Control Act).

At approximately 14:00, there was an explosion in a polyurethane panel crusher; its expansion within the silo increased the pressure and one of the outlet vents gave way, causing a second explosion noise. Subsequently a fire broke out, releasing smoke and gas, including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The alarm was set off at 14:05; 80 staff members were evacuated and the internal emergency plan (POI) was deployed. The internal safety teams made use of a factory fire hose and called the external emergency services at 14:15, who arrived between 14:30 and 14:45. The power supplies to the site were cut off and rainwater-network blocking valves were activated.The police force and gas, electricity and rail service representatives, as well as the deputy mayor and sub-prefect arrived on site. At 15:30, safety representatives evacuated the industrial and commercial zone (26 persons) and restricted movement for 500 local residents. A safety perimeter was established around the site. Fire service officials, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), cooled the silo with fire hoses. Foam was injected from above. The undertaking does not have any technical drawings of the silo at its disposal. The maximum hydrogen cyanide concentration recorded was 4 ppm, compared with the exposure limit value of 1.9 ppm. The extinguishing water overflowed the retention structure but still remained contained on site, retained by the waterproof external courtyard. At 19:00, power lines were reconnected and one production line resumed operation. The fire was fully extinguished at 22:00. At 01:00 a second production line resumed operation. During the emergency, one firefighter was affected by carbon monoxide. With resources from other departments, a network to measure the level of hydrogen cyanide in the affected area could be set up.The following day, at approximately 10:00, once the hatch had been opened, SCBA-equipped firefighters emptied the silo from the bottom. This work was then taken over by a private company. The inspectorate responsible for classified facilities attended the scene. The safety services completed their work by 20:00.There was only limited damage to the site: The cladding panels of a workshop were blackened by smoke and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired. All production lines, which were shutdown for a few hours and which remained intact, resumed operation on 15 November.The silo in question is used to store two forms of polyurethane dust waste: fine machining dust aspirated off and passed via a bag filter before being transferred to the silo and coarser sawdust particles aspirated off as waste from a polyurethane-panel crusher located directly adjacent to the silo (linked by 20 m of tubing to enable aspiration from the crusher to silo). The dust particles are ultra light, weighing 450 kg per 30 m\u00b3. Given the site layout, it is unlikely that the machining section caused the fault (given the intermediary transfer via the filter, the duration of the aspiration process, absence of metal components, etc.). It is probable that the crusher was responsible, considering the fire marks on that device and the fact that crushed panels contain a fine layer of aluminium that could have generated a spark. Moreover, the crushing of panels releases pentane, which can be explosive or flammable under certain conditions, such as, for example, when a crusher heats up. These panels are often the source of fires breaking out in storage containers during crushing. The operator examines these hypotheses in the accident report.The operator is looking into installing a spark detection system in conjunction with a valve diversion or water sprinkler system. Further measures are envisaged: increasing air dilution in the crusher area, installing pentane detectors, and installing a belt or screw conveyor for the open-air evacuation of crushed panels. The crusher will not resume operation until the completion of corrective and preventative measures, the implementation of which will be monitored at the next meeting of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT).

After the examination of the exchanger was performed, it was decided that leakness would be temporary\u00a0stopped with a caulker band. In order to do this the internal recue unit was called. They noticed punctual leaks in a few places. Before they started sealing operation it was decided to rinse/wash the exchanger again (doing this twice, in the same way as for the first time). Whille the caulker band was installed inside the exchanger there was water at a low preassure. After installation of the band it was decided to check the tightness using water. It appeared that it was not tight enaugh becasue water was leaking. The worker closed one valve to stop the water flow. At the same time he also opened another valve allowing the process solution to get into the system. The other worker, not being aware that process solution was being injected, thought the tightness tests were going on so he cut (with the valve) the flow of the flow of the process solution. This caused the process solution to go the broken exchanger. Suddenly the upper part of the echanger ruptured causing the emmision of the process solution. Due to its evaporation toxic claud was formed. One warker fell down because of the gust that appeared. The other five workers were intoxicated. All of them were injured and taken to the hospital.

The worker loaded an empty container on a fork-lift truck and drove to the storage tanks located 200 m from the installation. After filling the container and screwing the cap, the tank started to bulge. The worker slightly unscrewed the cap which brought back the normal shape to the container. The worker repeated this activity twice while transporting the container. Then the container was put on a ground in the production hall/room (a place where potassium nitrate was produced).

As this operation involves sorting the mix of semi-finished products to remove powders that are too coarse or too fine, the sieving machine is equipped with two sieve-type filters. In principle, the sieving apparatus operates automatically without an operator being present. A hopper containing approximately 250\u00a0kg of powder to be filtered is lifted on a hoist and positioned above the sieving unit. The hopper contents are discharged and filtered automatically. Powder of the correct diameter is collected in another hopper located under the unit. Powder that is too coarse or too fine is recovered in ad hoc containers (bags). It takes approximately 10\u00a0minutes for 250\u00a0kg of powder to be filtered. The tasks of operators assigned to this unit consist exclusively of, before filtering, positioning the inlet powder hopper ready to be picked up by the hoist and, after filtering, removing the outlet powder hopper for transfer to a storage area.",
        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  The accident occurred in a building in which propellent powders for ammunition with ADR classification UN1.3C are sieved. Sieving is one of the final processes in the manufacture of propellant powders. The sieving unit in question comprises two circular sieves positioned in series within a cylindrical housing made from stainless steel. The cylindrical housing is vibrated by forced oscillation and the spherical powder to be sieved is fed into the unit via a mobile hopper moved by hoist apparatus. At the machine outlet, after sorting according to grain size, the useable powders are retrieved in collection hoppers and waste is collected in suitable bags. In principle, the sieving apparatus operates automatically without an operator being present in the sieving hall. The operators fill the feed hoppers and empty the processed product from the collection hoppers when the machine is shut down. On the day of the accident, two operators were assigned to the sieving plant: a young employee on a short-term contract, still in training and an experienced operator in charge of training him. On 26\u00a0March 2013, the operators' first action was to dismantle and reassemble the sieving plant, as laid down in the operating procedure, with a view to cleaning it before starting the actual sieving of the powder. At around 4 a.m., a malfunction occurred in the sieving plant and a fire broke out in the machine which then spread to all the powder located in the sieving unit. The most experienced operator was in the room at that time (his attention had probably been drawn to a suspicious noise). The alarm was set off and the ultrafast-response flooding and sprinkler systems were triggered. Nonetheless, the fire spread to a second 250\u00a0kg hopper of powder which the second operator was bringing to the entrance to the room, and this generated a second fireball. Lastly, a third 250\u00a0kg hopper containing powder, probably already filtered, located outside the room and not yet removed to an appropriate storage place, also caught fire, generating a third fireball, which was observed by the witnesses that came to assist the victims. The two operators suffered serious second- and third-degree burns; they were, however, able to exit the building on their own and remained conscious during their transfer to specialised hospitals, where they received appropriate care. Despite this medical attention, in the weeks following the accident both victims died from the effects of their burns.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Observations indicate that the fast-closing fasteners on the sieving unit opened during the sieving process. Since they were no longer tightened in place, the filters shifted out of their housing, causing metal-on-metal friction which - probably - caused the powder to catch fire. The sieving unit's top cover had a confining effect when the powder was burning, leading to a build-up of pressure in the machine and - very probably - a deflagration of the product that would be the cause of the displacement and significant deformation of the cover. At this point, there was a sudden eruption of flames from the sieving unit which burned the operators then in the immediate vicinity of the machine. A nut used to fasten the sieve housing which was found on the floor after the accident shows no sign of being torn off, suggesting that it gradually worked loose during the sieving operations. The operator's presence in the hall could be attributable to his having approached the sieving unit in order to investigate the cause of the problem after becoming aware of some equipment malfunction (the abnormal noise) without shutting down the machine, despite the fact that procedure stipulates that entering the manufacturing hall is not permitted when the equipment is in operation. component/machinery failure/malfunction wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties",

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  At 10.15 a.m. on the morning of 25\u00a0July 2013, a series of explosions occurred in the finished products storage area of a fireworks factory. The initial explosions - three explosions in short succession according to calls from members of the public to the fire service [VVF] - presumably occurred in the vicinity of sheds No\u00a04 and 5, which were used to store finished products (fireworks), classified as category\u00a0IV and V under the National legislation regulating explosive factories and warehouses. Observations of the effects indicate that the sheds probably exploded en masse, i.e. involving all the material contents of the sheds simultaneously. The fire service's findings suggest that, at the time of the explosion, several factory employees - including the manager and two employees related to him, who were killed instantaneously - were loading products from the storage sheds onto vehicles parked nearby. Ignition presumably occurred during the handling of the explosives. It seems that the products being loaded were to be transferred onwards onto vans parked in the yard in front of the entrance gates for shipment to the venues where they would be used, since the vans had been partially loaded but still had to be fully loaded. In the days preceding the accident, the factory had been particularly busy preparing and shipping products for many planned fireworks displays; in particular, a fireworks display for a local festival was planned for the following day. At 10.55 a.m. there was a fourth explosion, in a delayed domino effect, in shed No\u00a08, which was used to store up to 9600\u00a0kg of category IV and V explosive material. The shed, already damaged by the shock wave from the initial explosions, was probably struck by burning debris thrown out by ongoing minor secondary blasts, and it too probably exploded en masse together with all the contents. This last explosion caused the death of a fourth employee (the son of the manager), who was hit by section of the roof of shed No\u00a08, and caused serious injuries to a fire-fighter working at the scene, who later died from the injuries. In total, the event caused the death of 4\u00a0factory employees, serious injuries to a fire-fighter, who died in hospital approximately three months later, and injuries to 3\u00a0employees and 5\u00a0fire-fighters, who were all hospitalised and subsequently recovered. The accident caused extensive material damage, with the factory's sheds destroyed almost completely, damage to civilian facilities adjacent to the factory perimeter and related to the factory, and damage to external civilian buildings within a radius of up to 1\u00a0km. Debris of various sizes from the sheds which exploded was found within a radius of up to 1\u00a0km. Lastly, the explosions caused environmental damage as they set off a series of large-scale forest fires in the surrounding natural and rural area within a radius of 500\u00a0m which were later extinguished by the fire service and the State Forestry Corps, deploying two aircraft. The main local authorities (including the Prefecture, the Carabinieri, the police department, the judiciary [judicial inspection] and the local health authority) intervened at the scene. No action was apparently taken by the Regional Planning and Environment Office to measure soil contamination due to chemicals dispersed as a result of the explosions. True False False False",
        "causes_description": "causes:  In tandem with the MARS inspection, the incident is currently being investigated by the local Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the official expert [CTU] appointed by the Public Prosecutor is drawing up the official expert report. As part of the judicial investigation, the area of the factory was sealed off and the company documentation on the premises at the time of the event was seized. As a result, although MARS inspectors were able to enter the sealed area (subject to prior authorisation from the PM at the request of the fire service), they have not been able to access the company's documentation. Given the above circumstances, it is only possible to formulate hypotheses on the causes of the accident, based on the information collected and measurements taken after the event by the inspection committee in the course of its inspection and making use of the data provided by several of the public authorities involved in post-accident operations, chiefly the local fire service and the Commander of the Carabinieri. Additional hypotheses have been put forward on the basis of information drawn from the interview with the manager's representative, the appointed expert [CTP], it being impossible to consult either the manager or his employees/family members (who were killed by the explosion). Some surviving relatives are still in a state of shock and receiving psychiatric treatment.The hypothetical conclusions based on post-accident data collected by the fire service and the Carabinieri are set out below.In the process of securing the location after the accident, primed explosive products (already fitted with electric fuses but not connected to a power supply) were found in the factory yard in front of the factory entrance and in the tool shed used as a garage for vans. It was not possible to identify the kind of primers and, consequently, if they were allowed or not inside the plant according with the national regulations. In general, under the national regulations fireworks must never be pre-armed inside the establishment. Considering the material damage sustained by the internal structures, in particular by the sheds with load-bearing walls made from reinforced concrete, and the containment walls, with evidence of disintegration and crushing, the probability is that there was a sympathetic detonation of the explosive material or an instantaneous explosion involving the entire quantity of material due to mechanical stress: this can be compatible with the potential presence in the area of the explosions of quantities of explosive products already, it is assumed, unlawfully primed. It should be added that, according to the statement of the Commander of the Carabinieri, explosive material, including primed material, was also found in the area belonging to the manager's residence and, specifically, in the vans parked in the tool shed and, lastly, fireworks were found in the basement of the tool shed. Considering the above hypotheses, it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process.This aspect goes beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators who, as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials; it suggests, rather, an excessive level of \u2018confidence\u2019 gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work involving materials that in fact entail a high level of intrinsic risk. To this may be added the probable situation of working under pressure, subject to constraints of time and space, in the days immediately preceding the event on account of the many orders for firework displays which the operators themselves were called upon to carry out by virtue of their acknowledged reputation in the sector.Furthermore, given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, considering the maximum quantity authorised within a shed, it may be hypothesised that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authority. Applying the above method with a highly conservative approximation of the case leads to the conclusion that the structural damage due to the pressure wave compatible with that observed on the outside buildings damaged ought to lie within a radius of less than 107\u00a0m; however, damage of this kind (lifting of the building's wooden roof, cornerstone movement, curtain wall damage, partition wall damage) were found at a radius of between 100\u00a0m and 500\u00a0m from the craters made by the explosions.Furthermore, on the subject of the quantity of explosives in stock, according to information reported by the Commander of the Carabinieri approximately 20\u00a0days after the event (13\u00a0August) some 0.2 tonnes of black powder were found stored in five drums in an abandoned hut outside the factory adjacent to the southern perimeter. There were no labels on the drums. This amount, together with the 0.43 tons found in shed No\u00a02 following the explosion, would exceed the authorised limit of 0.5 tonnes for black powder. Lastly, we should stress the domino effect of the initial explosions upon shed No\u00a08, first hit by the shock wave and then ignited, presumably by burning debris. In theory, compliance with National Regulations with regard to the distances between sheds should have prevented a domino effect of this kind but only if the authorised maximum quantities and types of explosives were also respected. These considerations again point to the root cause being the breach of safety requirements in terms of the quantity and type of explosive material authorised and/or stored and processed in the establishment. This is supported by the conclusions of the incident report drawn up by the local fire service, which managed the emergency response to the event.On the basis of information obtained from interviews with surviving relatives not currently in a psychological condition to have dealings with the inspection committee, the appointed expert [CTP] representing the manager reports that the operator was regularly asked to store (Authority request) quantities of explosive material entrusted to its legal custody after being confiscated by the police. This material,may be, in general, not well identified and consequently with an unknown (and potentially dangerous) behaviour, was stored in the sheds together with explosive products manufactured by the company. In particular, at the time of the accident, the appointed expert [CTP] reports that the stores held a quantity of confiscated explosive material roughly equivalent to 6 or 7\u00a0tons, in storage sheds No\u00a04 and No\u00a05 (where the initial series of explosions was found to have occurred). So the appointed expert [CTP] declares that the origin of explosions is probably attributable to the chemical decomposition of explosive material delivered into the company's legal custody by the police, stored in sheds No\u00a04 and No\u00a05 together with the company's own finished products. He therefore highlights the critical significance of the storage of unidentified confiscated explosive material which, as it loses chemical stability over time, presents an increased risk of explosive decomposition.",

In addition, again downstream of the explosions, chemical products (flammable and oxidising) used for mixes that had been kept in sheds No 6 and No 7 were dispersed over an area of outside land adjacent to the enclosure on the south and east sides.

The container was originally from the Pyh\u00e4salmi mine, where exactly one year earlier an attempt to load the blast holes in the roof of the tunnel with emulsion explosives by means of a new mobile explosive manufacturing unit (MEMU) failed. As a result of this, a significant amount of sensitized emulsion dropped onto the floor of the tunnel. The miners did not realize that the mixture of sensitized emulsion explosive and rock material was a non-conformity waste. Accordingly, the waste was handled as typical emulsion waste and was sent to Vihtavuori. The production volumes of bulk-emulsion explosives in Oy Forcit Ab have multiplied over the past few years because of increasing mining and infrastructure development. At the same time, bulk-emulsion explosives are being increasingly used instead of traditional explosives. Oy Forcit Ab has not been able to keep pace with the disposal of the emulsion waste. The emulsion waste occurs during both the production phase and the application phase. Emulsion waste containers have been stored mainly in the yard of the explosives factory and in the yard of the explosives warehouse. Tukes has requested that Forcit takes corrective actions to resolve the waste-container warehousing problem. Forcit has taken several corrective actions, but these actions have been inadequate due to the simultaneous increase in production volumes. The Explosives Act that is currently in force covers the production, use and disposal of traditional explosives.

The SCl2 hydrolysed upon contact with ambient humidity, causing an intensive emission of hydrogen chloride (HCl), which was not detected by the column's HCl gas detector (the threshold was at 25 ppm). A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated. The internal fire team, supported by 40 external fire fighters, equipped themselves with breathing apparatus and plugged the leak; the cloud of HCl was overcome using 4 lateral fire hose lines. The 120 m\u00b3 of water used was collected in a retention basin to be re-used in production. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 16.15. The next day, a specialised company pumped the 800 l (1200 kg) of spilled sulphur dichloride into the retention tank and then transferred to a storage vat. The HCl remained confined in the building. The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691).The leak was caused by a mechanical rupture in the recirculating pump of a storage tank which had been filled 50 minutes earlier. This was aggravated by the non-closure of an automatic valve at the base of the tank, despite the fact that it had been activated, firstly by the safety controller when it was shut off, and then by the shut-off at the base of the tank at 13.30. A mechanical problem was the origin of the non-closure of the valve at the base of the tank; there had been difficulties closing this for the past 10 days.

Once the sensor alarm threshold was reached (50 \u00b5S), the safety controller isolated the drainage circuit for exchanger condensates by closing a motorised valve. A second conductivity meter, which had not been functioning properly and was scheduled for replacement by maintenance staff, displayed a value of 0 \u00b5S. Uninformed of this malfunction, technicians decided to shut off the amine intake at 10:40 pm and extract a sample to confirm their suspicions; they notified the on-call operator, who carried out an on-site assessment of the situation at 11 pm. The operator then proceeded to bypass the conductivity meter in restarting production without waiting for laboratory results to be released.Around 11:30 that evening, external sensors detected a COCl2 concentration build-up. By 11:52, a pressure sensor on the vapour circuit was reading in the tens of bar, triggering shutdown of the unit by closing shutoff valves on both the enclosure confining the unit and the condensate drainage circuit. The quick sequence of these closure steps caused a water hammer that broke a drainage valve at the base of the exchanger; the remaining COCl2 spilled into the enclosure, lowering vacuum pressure and closing the exchanger bypass valves. COCl2 sensors inside the confinement detected a rise in COCl2 content, reaching saturation at 1:10 am (1,000 ppm). A tube opened inside the exchanger and a large quantity of COCl2 spread into the vapour circuit with pressure increasing rapidly. Before the circuit could be closed as a safety precaution, a small amount of gas escaped via the soda tank drainage circuit, whose buffer (lid) had not been sealed following an improper reassembly step.

Normal pressure is roughly 25 bar, and the system is protected by a 30 bar pressure relief valve. The pressure of 29 bar, although not too high for the installation, caused the connecting pipe to break on account of heavy wear resulting from undetected corrosion under the insulation.

The line was opened, and as they started grinding on the line support, an explosion occurred. The flame propagated back into the tank, causing a second explosion inside. The tank ripped open and was catapulted into the air, killing both victims in the process. The explosion was caused by the unexpected presence of a considerable amount of hydrogen in the tank. The hydrogen was formed in a reaction of traces of metal powder and the hydrochloric acid, and must have accumulated over a period of two months. The traces of metal powder were present in the acid feed to the storage tank. This was the result of an incomplete reduction reaction in an upstream reactor. In that reactor, the metal powder was used to remove traces of metaloxides from the acid. Since 2009, the reactor was being operated at a lower temperature than the process was designed for, resulting in a lower reaction rate. Due to the lower reaction rate, traces of unreacted metal powder were present in the feed sent from the reactor to the intermediate storage vessel.

When combustion is initiated, wet nitrocellulose does not make the transition to detonation. In dry form, however, nitrocellulose is an explosive substance classified 1.1. Although classified 4.1, nitrocellulose detonation is nonetheless possible up to water concentrations of 80\u00a0% if there is considerable energy input in the form of a shock wave generated by another explosive detonating in the vicinity and triggering a detonation reaction. In that case detonation is possible even with water present. The transition from combustion to detonation is not, however, possible with the wet product. The spontaneous inflammation temperature of nitrocellulose is 160 C. It is estimated that 10 to 30\u00a0kg of powder detonated.

Samples are taken for laboratory analysis to determine the product's characteristics and precise nitrocellulose content. The product is then introduced into the formulation circuit. Recycled and recovered nitrocellulose powders are stored in water in tanks located on the ground floor of the building. They are first transferred, via a centrifugal pump, to a pycnometer to be weighed and then pumped into other mixing tanks, where dampened nitrocellulose in the form of cotton is added, before being pumped once again to a neighbouring building for use in later stages of the process.",

(The process involves the manufacture in an aqueous medium of small spherical granules from fresh or recycled nitrocellulose prior to adding nitroglycerine.) Although the recovered powder crusher is not implicated in the accident, it was damaged as a result of the fire in the building. The formulations are made from granules recycled after sieving, crushed single-base recovered powders and fresh nitrocellulose in the form of nitrocotton fibres. To make the formulations, nitrocellulose granules of various origins, stored under water in tanks in the building where the accident occurred, are transferred between tanks in the neighbouring buildings and the tanks in this building via a network of piping fitted with centrifugal pumps. The nitrocellulose granules in the building in question are first pumped into a pycnometer tank to be weighed and then transferred to other decanting and formulation tanks located in the same building. The formulations produced in this way are then transferred, by pumping, to granulation tanks at a later stage in the production line, where they are dissolved in ethyl acetate. An explosion occurred in the transfer pump and the piping linking storage tank B5 with the pycnometer tank during the transfer of nitrocellulose granules in the medium of water between these tanks. The investigations showed that the explosion of wet single-base powder had created detonation conditions in the pump and the vertical pipes downstream of the pump. A quantity of powder estimated at between 10\u00a0kg and 30\u00a0kg was detonated in the accident. The detonation sheared open tanks B4 and B5 in the vicinity of the pump in question. Tank B5, contained granules recycled after sieving and was almost empty, spilled into a pit and the contents of tank B4, consisting of recovered powder in the form of monotubular grains, were partially discharged onto the building's concrete floor and were not involved in the explosive reaction. It is estimated that there were 6 tonnes of powder in tank B4 at the time of the explosion. The other tanks in the building and the pipe network were seriously damaged by the primary debris from the detonation of the pump and piping and by the blast wave. The explosion caused major damage to the building and threw debris out to a radius of 50 to 70\u00a0metres. Windows were broken within a radius of 100-150\u00a0metres.

        "causes_description": "causes:  The hypothesis that nitrocellulose in a water medium could burn and then detonate as a transition from combustion without being primed by another detonation was initially considered but then ruled out after testing. The detonation of the wet nitrocellulose granules must have been triggered by an initial detonation of dry material. It was concluded that the cause was a technical issue associated with the type of pump which had led to a possible temperature increase in the nitrocellulose granules after loss of prime and drainage of the pump chamber. The creation of a vortex in the tank upstream of the pump caused the pump to lose its prime, enabling the nitrocellulose granules in the pump to come back into contact with air and, in local areas, dry out. The hypothesis is that the dried powder trapped behind the pump impeller then became hot and detonated inside the pump chamber, transferring the detonation to the column of wet nitrocellulose located above the pump. The fact that the pipework upstream of the pump found after the explosion was not destroyed by an internal detonation supports the hypothesis that a vortex caused the pipes to be drained prior to the explosion. Hypotheses and deductions: 1) Vortex effect: It seems that the level of tank B5, to which the centrifugal pump was connected, was low at the time of the accident. In identical circumstances on earlier occasions operators had noticed a vortex effect at the bottom of the tank which could be the cause of air ingress into the pump, causing it to lose prime. During tests to try to recreate the circumstances of the accident, the operator noted: - a 50 C increase in the (surface) temperature of the pump within 15 minutes; - that the liquid column downstream of the pump failed to empty. Thus, since there is no longer a flow of liquid to the vertical column but only an oscillating phenomenon caused by intermittent discharge of the unprimed pump, the solid particles tend to drop to the bottom of the column, near the pump, where they form a blockage that stops liquid flowing back into the pump and keeping the product residues in the pump wet. 2) Sequence of events: It is hypothesised that the following sequence of events led to the accident: - Air ingress caused by a vortex led to the pump losing prime, obstructing the movement of the product through the pipes and a blockage forming in the column downstream, preventing liquid flowing back. The lack of liquid flow combined with the presence of air caused the pump to heat up and, in local areas, dry out the nitrocellulose. At the same time, nitrocellulose particles dropped into the column downstream of the pump. - The nitrocellulose particles inside the pump became drier in local areas, caught fire and detonated, causing a second detonation of the wet powder in the downstream piping. other",

The situation developed into a critical condition. Air is believed to have flowed from the lower regenerator to the reactor. An increasing amount of hydrocarbons was carried with the catalyst from the reactor to the regenerator. As a result of increased supply of CO and hydrocarbons from the regenerator, the boilers shut down due to high temperature. Smoke started to flow from an emergency chimney. There was risk of feed flowing to the regenerator and of introducion of air to the reactor via the upper regenerator. Further development was, however, prevented by the panel operator manually activating the emergency shut-down of the air compressor. This action was taken approximately 6,5 minutes into the incident. Following the emergency shut-down of the air compressor, two critical sliding valves between the reactor and regenerator were left in an open position. Smoke continued to flow from the emergency chimney and later a fire started from the same chimney.The emergency response organisation was mobilised and evacuation of the site was carried out.

        "causes_description": "causes:  History of 2\u201d drain valveLittle information is available about the history of the 2\u201d drain valve. This valve is not used during normal operation of the unit, only during startup (connection for flushing with nitrogen).The following information is available:The line was originally installed in 1984;o Works were done on the system in 2003;The valve is installed at a height of about 4 meters above grade;o Works on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds;The construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run;There are no records about repairs of the valve;o According to the original specifications, the 2\u201d drain valves should be a carbon steel drain valve. However, the installed valve is a stainless steel valve.It is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds. As a result of previous incidents with valve packing followers, a visual verification of isolation valves in stainless steel systems was launched prior to the incident on 25/04/2015. The 2\u201d drain valve that failed on 25/04 was in the scope of this verification and some comments were reported about the status of the valve:No ice formation o Corrosion of boltsIncident investigation resultsInvestigation of the failed valve shows clearly advanced corrosion of the nuts of the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve. The following construction materials were encountered:o The bonnet and body of the valve are constructed from austenitic stainless steel (316);The valve is installed on a line constructed of low temperature carbon steel;The 4 studs used to connect the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of ferritic stainless steel (410);The 8 nuts on the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of carbon steel;The following conclusions can be drawn upon investigation of the recovered valve:The severe corrosion of the 8 carbon steel nuts on the 4 stainless steel studs/valve (see Figure 8) is consistent with a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion of the nuts.The 4 stainless steel studs of the valve bonnet/body connection are in good condition.o Some of the nuts are missing because they were torn off during the ejection of the valve bonnet.o It is possible that the severely corroded nuts (including the missing nuts) were all located at the same side of the valve bonnet/body connection (back side).According to the original specification, the 2\u201d drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve instead of a stainless steel valve.o Besides carbon steel nuts on the studs of the valve bonnet/body connection, carbon steel nuts were also discovered on the studs of the valve flange/body connection (the 8 nuts on the blind flange are a mix of carbon steel nuts and stainless steel nuts. The carbon steel nuts are corroded.).Upon ejection of the bonnet of the 2\u201d drain valve, the bonnet hit a nearby propylene pipeline. This propylene pipe was hit in an horizontal plane above the horizontal plane of the original location of the 2\u201d drain valve, suggesting that the nuts that failed first were the ones located on the bottom half of the bonnet/body connection.Extensive corrosion of carbon steel nutsThe catastrophic failure of the carbon steel nuts of the valve bonnet/body connection occurred because of severe corrosion of the carbon steel nuts on the stainless steel studs.The extensive corrosion of the carbon steel nuts is a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion.Installation of stainless steel valve with stainless steel studs in low temperature carbon steel lineThe line was originally installed in 1984. According to the original specification, the 2\u201d drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve. However, the installed valve was made of austenitic stainless steel (316). It is possible that the valve that failed is the originally installed valve.Installation of carbon steel nuts on stainless steel studs of stainless steel 2\u201d valveWorks on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds since the construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run. There are no records about repairs of the valve (records were checked until 1998). It is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds.Valve in humid environmentThe valve is constantly in a wet environment due to the condensation of water vapor in ambient air. The presence of this wet environment is a necessary condition for both galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion to occur (presence of electrolyte).Nuts not protected against atmospheric corrosionThe carbon steel nuts were not protected against atmospheric corrosion (e.g. by paint or selection of corrosion resistant material).Nuts in carbon steelThe nuts used to tighten the stainless steel studs were made of carbon steel.Condensation of water vapor in airThere is a constant condensation of water vapor in air at the location of the valve due to the low temperature of the fluid in the low temperature carbon steel line and because of the lack of thermal insulation on the valve.Installation of valve not meeting specificationsIt is not unusual to install equipment parts made of more noble materials in systems made of less noble materials, provided that the compatibility of the materials is checked and that appropriate measures are taken to avoid galvanic corrosion.Valve not thermally insulatedThe valve is installed in a thermally insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The valve as such was not insulated.Process at -6 C. The valve is installed in an insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The operating temperature of the fluid in the line is about -6 C.Inspection of lineThe 2\u201d drain valve was part of lines that are inspected inside the RBI scope. The line with the valve that failed was assessed to lie in the low risk area of the RBI matrix. The lines in this low risk area are inspected by visual verification of the state of the line during site visits (frequency of these visits is every 5 years).An inspection report of this particular line from a previous inspection cycle (2009) is available. This line was scheduled to be subjected to a more detailed inspection (with thickness measurements etc.) in the next inspection cycle (to be carried out in the turnaround of 2016). A request of this more detailed inspection was applied in a pre-inspection report of end 2014. The state of the valve that failed was insufficiently detected in the visual inspections of 2009. training/instruction manufacture/construction vessel/container/containment-equipment failure corrosion/fatigue",

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  At about 16.30, a biogas detection alarm intermittently sounded in the control room of a large urban wastewater treatment plant, and the operator in charge transmitted the alert to the security station. Thinking that the alarm could be due to a problem with the sensor, a security guard equipped with breathing apparatus went to a manhole leading to the underground pipes that feed into the digesters for producing biogas, and confirmed that there was a pocket of biogas beside the sensor and also in two nearby manholes (100% of the lower explosive limit (LEL)). The site duty officer was alerted at 17.30 and, suspecting a leak in an underground pipe, he decided to shut off the sludge mixing booster and to mechanically ventilate the contaminated manhole shafts. The measure was lifted at 18.30 without the leaking pipe having been located, due to the tight network of underground pipes in the area.The investigation was resumed 72 hours later, and measures were taken to reduce the flow of the leak and secure the area during the investigation. This was successful after 60 hours, when a 4 cm hole was discovered at a depth of 4 m in cast-iron piping (DN 400, PS=18 mbar) connecting two of the plant's digesters to the gasholders. 24 000 m\u00b3 of biogas was lost as a result of the leak. Since they could not be shut down, the output of these digesters was reduced by shutting off the mixing, heating and intake of sludge; the biogas zone was sealed off and ventilation was set up near the leak. A sleeve was placed over the leaky section, which was secured until the complete shutdown of the digesters it fed into, and its output (18 500 m\u00b3 of biogas) was progressively released into the atmosphere through the release valves. A segment of the pipe collapsed during the work, rendering repair impossible. The section of pipe was then isolated using a reversible joint of the 'panhandle' type. The biogas network and the station's other digesters were then put back into operation.

The gradual internal corrosion of the cast-iron piping was the origin of the incident. The biogas released from the digester was very humid near the leak, because the first bleeding takes place after the location of the leak. In addition, the biogas produced in this plant has a higher H2S concentration than that from other sludge digestion plants, because the sludge contains less ferric chloride (which neutralises H2S). Finally, these biogas pipes are among the oldest on the site, and as a result have suffered longer exposure to the corrosive agents in biogas. corrosion/fatigue",

        "he_description": "hazardous_events:  A runaway reaction in a tank truck which was being processed by means of direct injection into a rotating drum furnace caused pressure to build up in that tank truck. That build-up of pressure caused the bursting disk to burst, the safety valve to open and then the tank truck to split open. As the tank truck split open, the gas cloud which had been released via the safety valve was ignited. The force with which the tank truck split open caused other tank trucks nearby to move and some of them to be torn open, resulting in a pool fire. Account of events before the accident - On 25 February at 15:50 the processing of the product started. A temperature of 55  C was then measured in the line from the truck to the furnace. The tank was delivered on 25 February at 10:00 and the delivery temperature was 35  C. The aim was to start processing at 12:00, but this could not be done because the product was too viscous and the tank was warmed up with steam (6 bar - 160  C). At 15:50 it was decided to try again to start the processing and from that time the temperature in the feedline was logged. The temperature in the tank itself was lower than the temperature measured in the feedline because the measurement was taken in the feedline to the furnace, where the product had been additionally warmed up through tracing. - On 26 February at around 10:00 (the steam (heating) to the tank was still on) it was noted that the N2 flow, press the tank empty, dropped, but the supply to the furnace remained the same. This indicated that a different mechanism (see below) was causing pressure in the tank. - On 26 February 2016 at around 11:00 the steam heating of the tank was stopped after inspecting it and checking the temperature gauge on the tank, which read 45  C at that moment. The log shows that at that moment the temperature in the feedline was 124  C.- On 26 February between 11:30 and 12:00 there was a brief standstill in the direct injection owing to the normal operation of the incineration process in the oven itself. During that standstill the gas release outlet from the tank to the furnace was opened automatically because of high pressure in the tank. This was not noticed by the operators.- On 26 February at 12:00 the direct injection was started again. After that start N2 flow was no longer required in order to feed the furnace (the pressure in the tank itself was apparently sufficient). The feed flow to the furnace fluctuated a lot after the stoppage. This was possibly attributable to gas bubbles in the product being fed into the furnace. Those gas bubbles posed a problem for the flow gauge. Later on, the pressure built up more and more: The gas release outlet to the furnace was more and more open, the tank\u2019s bursting disc and safety valve opened and finally the tank burst at 15:33. The operators present at the tank truck fled when the safety valve opened. Therefore nobody was injured.

        "causes_description": "causes:  Cause of the build-up of pressure in the tank: - Build-up of pressure resulting from a (runaway) decomposition reaction: At laboratory scale the waste flow showed an exothermic polymerisation reaction at a temperature of 129  C (in practice 120  C). At higher temperatures a decomposition reaction takes place. For ACA itself that decomposition temperature is 157  C, but for the waste flow it is lower. - The tank was heated with steam for 20 hours. During the inspection visit on 3 May 2016 the firm explained that the log showed that this was the first time that the heating on the tank itself stayed on for so long. There is no rule for tank heating time because this was not regarded as critical before the accident. It is a mere coincidence that on previous occasions the heating had never been on for so long. Although there is a concern to prevent blockages in the feedline to the furnace and therefore the heating is left on for long enough. The handling fiche for direct injection states that the tank should be additionally heated to 40  C. This temperature should be checked during inspection rounds. This would show that the temperature measurement on the tank itself read 45  C at the moment when the heating was turned off. - Calculations made by the firm show that, in view of the heating method (halfcoil connected to 6 bar steam), the heating period, the reduction of the quantity of product in the tank as a result of the feed and the properties of the product, it is possible that the temperature at which the decomposition reaction starts was in fact reached in the tank. Those calculations also took into account the product\u2019s viscosity, which hampers heat transfer such that in places higher temperatures could be reached. - This information was not known to the firm before the accident and so no attention was paid to this aspect when the firm accepted the product for processing or when changes were made to the processing. process analysis",
